<h1>The Interceptor-Stateless Session Bean Sample Application</h1>
This is a very simple EJB 3.0 Stateless Session Bean with a Remote
business interface that uses EJB 3.0 interceptor mechanism to validate
the parameter passed to a business method.

<h3>Business Interface</h3>
<p>The Stateless Session bean has a Remote business interface
with a single business method.
<pre>
import javax.ejb.Remote;

@Remote
public interface StatelessSession {
    public String initUpperCase(String val)
        throws BadArgumentException;
}</pre>

<p>
Note that unlike prior versions of EJB, the Remote interface is <b>not</b>
required to extend java.rmi.Remote and its business methods are <b>not</b>
required to throw java.rmi.RemoteException. Here, BadArgumentException
is an application exception.
  <p>
The business interface is designated as a remote business interface via
the @javax.ejb.Remote annotation.
</p>

<h3>Stateless Session Bean Class</h3>
<p>
Here's the bean implementation:
<pre>
@Stateless
@Interceptors({ NullChecker.class, ArgumentsChecker.class })
public class StatelessSessionBean
    implements StatelessSession  {
    public String initUpperCase(String val) {
       String first = val.substring(0, 1);
       return first.toUpperCase() +
val.substring(1);
   }
}
</pre>
<p>
The annotation <code>@javax.ejb.Stateless</code> defines the component and designates
this class as the bean class for a stateless session bean.

<p>
The business method converts the first character in the parameter to
upper case. Note that the business method does not check if the
argument is null OR if the parameter starts with a alphabet. It could
have been done in the business method itself, but we use the EJB 3.0
interceptor facility to do the parameter validation checks.

<p>
Interceptors are used to interpose on business method invocations and
life cycle events that occur on an enterprise bean instance. An
interceptor class is just like any other java class. It need not extend
any special class nor does it need to implement any well known
interface. An interceptor class defines (exactly) one business method
interceptor method by annotating a method with @AroundInvoke
annotation. The method must take javax.interceptor.InvocationContext as
argument and must return java.lang.Object. (Note:- It is possible to
declare interceptors and interceptor methods using .xml file, but for
this sample we will use only annotations).

<p>
More than one interceptor can be chained to interpose a single business
method. @Interceptors is an annotation that can be used to indicate the
list of interceptors to be invoked before any business methods are
invoked on this bean. Note that since this annotation is defined at the
type level, the interceptors are fired before every business method is invoked. The
@Interceptors annotation is defined in javax.interceptor package.
</p>

<h3>Interceptor classes</h3>
<p>
The bean lists (using @Interceptor
annotation) the list of interceptors to be fired before its business
methods are called. Here the bean list two interceptors: NullChecker
and ArgumentsChecker. The name of these classes can be anything. The
exact method to be invoked on these interceptors is designated using
the @AroundInvoke annotation. The @AroundInvoke annotation is defined
in javax.interceptor package.

<p>
In our sample, the two interceptors are defined as follows:

<pre>
package enterprise.interceptor_stateless_ejb;

import java.lang.reflect.Method;
import javax.interceptor.AroundInvoke;
import javax.interceptor.InvocationContext;

public class NullChecker {

    @AroundInvoke
    public Object checkIfNull(InvocationContext ctx)
        throws Exception {
        Method method = ctx.getMethod();
        if (method.getName().equals("initUpperCase")) {
            String param = (String) (ctx.getParameters()[0]);
                if (param == null) {
                    throw new BadArgumentException("Illegal argument: null");
              }
          }
// An interceptor can throw any runtime exception or
// application exceptions that are allowed in the
// throws clause of the business method

        return ctx.proceed();    // Proceed to the next interceptor
    }
}

package enterprise.interceptor_stateless_ejb;

import java.lang.reflect.Method;
import javax.interceptor.AroundInvoke;
import javax.interceptor.InvocationContext;

public class ArgumentsChecker {

    @AroundInvoke
    public Object checkArgument(InvocationContext ctx) throws Exception {
        Method method = ctx.getMethod();
        if (method.getName().equals("initUpperCase")) {
            String param = (String) (ctx.getParameters()[0]);
            //Note that param cannot be null because
            //it has been validated by the previous interceptor
            char c = param.charAt(0);
            if (!Character.isLetter(c)) {
                throw new BadArgumentException("Illegal argument: " + param);
            }
        }
// An interceptor can throw any runtime exception or
// application exceptions that are allowed in the
// throws clause of the business method

        return ctx.proceed();  // Proceed to call the business method
    }
}
</pre>

<p>
Before a business method is invoked, the
container invokes the interceptor method (annotated with @AroundInvoke)
of each interceptor. In our sample, before the bean's initUpperCase()
method is invoked, the checkIfNull() and checkArgument() methods are
invoked,in that order.

<p>
AroundInvoke methods run in the same Java call
stack as the bean business method. For a single business method
invocation, the container passes (the same) instance of
InvocationContext to all the interceptor methods. The InvocationContext
(defined in javax.interceptor package) provides various methods to
examine as well as modify the parameter values passed to the business
method.

<p>The proceed() method in InvocationContext causes the
next interceptor method in the chain to be invoked or, when called from
the last AroundInvoke interceptor method, the bean's business method.
Interceptor methods must always call InvocationContext.proceed() or no
subsequent interceptor methods or bean business method or life cycle
callback methods will be invoked.<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>

<p>In our sample, the interceptor methods use the
InvocationContext.getMethod() and InvocationContext.getParameters()
method to examine the parameter passed to the initUpperCase() business
method.  The NullChecker throws BadArgumentException if the
parameter
is null whereas the ArgumentChecker throws BadArgumentException if the
first character in the string is not a letter. Note that An interceptor
can throw any runtime exception or application exceptions that are
allowed in the throws clause of the business method. If the
interceptors find the parameter value to be valid, they call
InvocationContext.proceed()

<h3>Deployment Descriptor</h3>
<p> The good news is the deployment descriptor is no longer
required!  The two Java files above are sufficient to completely
describe this stateless session bean.
</p>

<h3>Sun-Specific Deployment Configuration</h3>
<p>You do not need to define any Sun-Specific deployment
descriptors (for example <code>sun-ejb-jar.xml</code> and <code>sun-application-client.xml</code>) for this
example.   The JNDI name for the Remote Stateless Session bean will default to:
enterprise.interceptor_stateless_ejb.StatelessSession#enterprise.interceptor_stateless_ejb.StatelessSession
