<h1>JAXB 2.0 Unmarshal &amp; Read Sample Application</h1>
<p>
This sample application demonstrates how to unmarshal an instance
document
into a Java content tree and access data contained within it.
</p>
<p>
This sample first complies the "purchase order" schema by using JAXB's
schema compiler XJC, to generate Java classes that represent the
schema:
</p>
<pre><xmp>
&lt;xjc schema="po.xsd" package="primer.po" destdir="gen-src"&gt;
  &lt;produces dir="gen-src/primer.po" includes="**/*.java" /&gt;
&lt;/xjc&gt;
</xmp></pre>
<p>
Then the following code is used to read an XML file into a Java object:
</p>
<pre>// create an Unmarshaller<br>Unmarshaller u = jc.createUnmarshaller();<br><br>// unmarshal a po instance document into a tree of Java content<br>// objects composed of classes from the primer.po package.<br>JAXBElement&lt;?&gt; poElement = (JAXBElement&lt;?&gt;)u.unmarshal( new File( "po.xml" ) );<br>PurchaseOrderType po = (PurchaseOrderType)poElement.getValue();<br></pre>
<h2>Building and Running the Application</h2>
<p>
</p>
<p>Following are the instructions for building and running
this sample application. <br>
<br>
</p>
<ol>
  <li> Setup your build environment and Configure the application
server with which the build system has to work by following the <a
 href="../../../docs/UserREADME.html">
common build instructions.</a></li>
  <li><code><i>app_dir</i></code> is the sample application base
directory: <code><i>samples_install_dir</i>/javaee5/webservices/simple-jaxb</code>.</li>
  <li><code></code><code></code>Change directory to <code><i>app_dir.<br>
    </i></code></li>
  <li>Build and run the sample application using the target all<code></code></li>
  <p><code><span style="font-style: italic;">app_dir&gt; </span></code>ant
all </p>
  <li>It is possible to do the above separately by issuing separate
commands as given below.</li>
  <p><code><span style="font-style: italic;">app_dir&gt; </span>ant
compile</code> compiles and packages the application </p>
  <p><code><span style="font-style: italic;">app_dir&gt; </span>ant
run</code> runs the program </p>
  <p><code><span style="font-style: italic;">app_dir&gt; </span>ant
javadoc</code> to generate javadoc for the generated Java source code </p>
  <li>Use the target clean to remove the temporary directories like
build and dist.
    <p><code><span style="font-style: italic;">app_dir&gt; </span>ant
clean</code> </p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Building, Deploying, and Running the Application in NetBeans IDE</h2>
<p>
Follow these instructions to build, deploy, and run
this sample application using NetBeans IDE.
</p>
<ol>
  <li> Refer to  <a href="../../../docs/UserREADME.html"> common build instructions.</a>
       for setting up NetBeans IDE and the application server with which the IDE will use.</li>
  <li> Make usre that you have defined the appropriate values in build.properties based on above
       common build instructions which is a pre-requisite for this sample.
  <li> In NetBeans IDE, select File->OpenProject and select 
<code><i>samples_install_dir</i>/javaee5/webservices/simple-jaxb</code> as the project.</li>
  <li> Right click on <code>simple-jaxb</code> and select <code>Run Project</code> which will build, deploy and run the project. Sample output is given below. </li>
