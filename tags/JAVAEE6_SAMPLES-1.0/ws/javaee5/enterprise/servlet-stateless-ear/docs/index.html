<h1>The Servlet-Stateless Session Bean Sample Application</h1>
<p>
This is a simple EJB 3.0 stateless session bean with a local
business interface that is invoked from a servlet. This sample
demonstrates the concept of dependency injection - one of the new
features of Java EE 5.0.

<h2>Business Interface</h2>
<p>The stateless session bean has a local business interface
with a single business method.

<pre>
package enterprise.servlet_stateless_ejb;

public interface StatelessSession {
    public String sayHello(String name);
}
</pre>

  <p>
The lack of any annotation here implies that the StatelessSession is a
local interface. To be more explicit, the javax.ejb.Local annotation
can be used.


<h2>Stateless Session Bean Class</h2>
<p>The bean implementation is:
<pre>
package enterprise.servlet_stateless_ejb;

import javax.ejb.Stateless;

@Stateless
public class StatelessSessionBean
    implements StatelessSession {

    public String sayHello(String name) {
        return "Hello, " + name + "!\n";
    }
</pre>

<h2>Servlet class</h2>
<p>
The servlet presents a text box to the user where
the user can type a name. When the user clicks the submit button, the
servlet greets the user whose name was typed in the text box.
Internally, the servlet invokes the sayHello method of the stateless
session bean passing the user name as the argument. 

<p> 
The servlet declares an instance variable whose type
is same as the business interface of the session bean. Traditionally,
the servlet would have looked up the bean's home interface from the
component's environment and then would have created an instance using
the create method of the home interface. However, with Java EE 5.0, the
servlet can just declare its dependency on the bean by just annotating
the instance variable with the @EJB annotation. At runtime, when the
servlet instance is created, the container injects (or provides) an
instance of an object that implements the business interface. <br>

<h2>Building, Deploying, and Running the Application</h2>
<p>
</p>
<p>Follow these instructions to build, deploy, and run
this sample application. 
</p>
<ol>
  <li> Setup your build environment and Configure the application
server with which the build system has to work by following the <a
 href="../../../docs/UserREADME.html">
common build instructions.</a></li>
  <li><code><i>app_dir</i></code> is the sample application base
directory: <code><i>samples_install_dir</i>/javaee5/enterprise/servlet-stateless-ear</code></li>
  <li><code></code><code></code>Change directory to <code><i>app_dir.<br>
    </i></code></li>
  <li>Build, Deploy and run the sample application using the target all<code></code></li>
  <p><code><i>app_dir&gt;</i></code>ant
all</p>
  <li>The sample can be run by pointing your browser to the following
URL: <a href="http://localhost:8080/servlet-stateless-war/servlet">http://localhost:8080/servlet-stateless-war/servlet</a>
Or by calling ant run target<br>
  </li>
  <li>Use the targets "undeploy"&nbsp; and "clean"to undeploy the
sample application and to
remove the temporary directories like build and dist.
    <p><code><i>app_dir&gt; </i>ant
undeploy clean</code> </p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Building, Deploying, and Running the Application in NetBeans IDE</h2>
<p>
Follow these instructions to build, deploy, and run
this sample application using NetBeans IDE.
</p>
<ol>
  <li> Refer to  <a href="../../../docs/UserREADME.html"> common build instructions.</a>
       for setting up NetBeans IDE and the application server with which the IDE will use.</li>
  <li> In NetBeans IDE, select File->OpenProject and select 
<code><i>samples_install_dir</i>/javaee5/enterprise/servlet-stateless-ear</code> as the project.</li>
  <li> Right click on <code>servlet-stateless-ear</code> and select <code>Run Project</code> which will build, deploy and run the project. If configured properly, the IDE will open the browser with appropriate url. Sample output is given below. </li>
  <b>NetBeans IDE output</b>
  <pre>
