<h1>The [application name] Sample Application</h1>
<p>
<i>Provide general description of the application here: it's purpose
and how it works at a high level.
Try to keep it brief and to the point.
</i></p>
<p><i>
NOTE: Be sure to change the paths for all relative links based on the
location of this file.
Otherwise, the links won't work.
</i></p>
<h2>Setting up the environment</h2>
<p>
<i>This section is only for apps that require database access, or other
external resources such as JMS.
Remove if app doesn't use a database, MQ, or other such external
resource.
Below is a template: add/modify as appropriate.
</i></p>
<p>
Before you deploy or run the application, you must ensure that a
database resource has been configured for
Application Server. You can use any JDBC-compliant relational database
server, but specific instructions
are provided for the following:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Java DB</b>: Java DB comes with Application Server in most
configurations.
For more information, see <a href="../../../../../docs/derby.html">Using
the Java DB Database with
Sample Applications</a>.
  </li>
  <li><b>PointBase</b>: a small-footprint Java relational database.
For more information, see <a href="../../../../../docs/pointbase.html">Using
PointBase with the Samples</a>
  </li>
  <li><b>Oracle</b>: One of the most popular relational databases.
For more information, see <a href="../../../../../docs/oracle.html">How
to run samples with
Oracle database server</a>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<h2>Additional Configuration Steps</h2>
<p>
<i>If any other additional configuration steps are required, describe
them here.
For example, creating JDBC connection pools and resources.
</i></p>
<h2>Building, Deploying, and Running the Application</h2>
<p>
<i>Replace the paths and file names below with those of the app.
If the app does not have an EAR file, replace with the equivalent, for
example, WAR file.
</i></p>
<p>
The general instructions for building, deploying, and running sample
applications are provided in
<a href="../../../../../docs/common-procedures.html">Building,
Deploying, and Running Sample Applications</a>.
In reading this document, use the following variables for this
application:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><code><i>install_dir</i></code> is the directory where
Application Server is installed. </li>
  <li><code><i>app_dir</i></code> is the application base directory: <code><i>install_dir</i>/samples/foo/bar/baz</code>.
  </li>
  <li><i>appname</i> is the application name: foobar. </li>
  <li>The prebuilt EAR file is <code>foo.ear</code>.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
Follow this general procedure:
</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="../../../../../docs/common-procedures.html#build">Build
the Application</a>. The build file, <code>build.xml</code>, is in the
    <code><i>app_dir</i></code> directory. </li>
  <li><a href="../../../../../docs/common-procedures.html#deploy">Deploy
the Application</a> The EAR file is <code><i>install_dir</i>/samples/foo/bar/baz/foo.ear</code>.
  </li>
  <li><a href="../../../../../docs/common-procedures.html#run">Run the
Application</a> The application name is foo.
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>Running the Sample Application</h3>
<p>
<i>If the app uses a standalone or ACC Java client (not a web client),
then replace step 3 with appropriate instructions
for running the client and accessing the app here.
</i></p>
<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>
<i>Include any pertinent troubeshooting info here.
Below is a template: add/modify as appropriate.
</i></p>
<p>If you have problems when running the application, try the
following:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Review the log files, as described in
    <a href="../../../../docs/common-procedures.html">Building,
Deploying, and Running Sample Applications</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
Make sure the database is running.
To reset your database, run the command <code>asant sql</code> if
using Derby</li>
  <li>To redeploy the application, you must undeploy it first. Use the
commands
    <code>asant undeploy</code>, <code>asant clean</code> and then <code>asant
all</code>.
  </li>
</ul>
