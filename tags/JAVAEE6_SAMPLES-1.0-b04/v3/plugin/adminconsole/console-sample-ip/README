This is a sample project that creates a plugin module to GlassFish v3 Admin
Console to demonstrate the available Integration Points.  The goal is to
update this project whenever another Integration Point is available.

For a list of available Integration Point,  refer to:
http://wiki.glassfish.java.net/Wiki.jsp?page=V3IntegrationPoint

The plugin jar is available as you check out this project.  If you want to
build your own or rebuild after making modifications, you can perform these 3
steps (otherwise, you can skip this):

    1.  cd project
    2.  mvn install
    3.  cd ..

To install:

    1.  cp project/target/console-sample-ip-plugin.jar  <GFv3-INSTALL>/glassfish/modules/.
    2.  restart the server. 

Access the Console, by default: http://localhost:4848/

You should see the sample tree nodes, tabs, commonTask etc. added to the admin console.
