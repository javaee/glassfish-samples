		<span class="j1holnote">LAB-4520: Plug into GlassFish v3 with JavaServer Faces and jMaki</span><br />
		Hands-on Lab!!</h1>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>	In this lab you completed 3 exercises.  In each of those Exercises
	you learned a little bit more about building a plugin module for the
	GlassFish v3 Application Server.  Let us review what you have
	accomplished.</p>

    <p class="j1holheader">Exercise 1:</p>

    <p>	In this exercise you completed your first GlassFish v3 Plugin Module.
	This included implementing an HK2 GlassFish plugin module which was
	installed in the <code>modules</code> directory of the GlassFish v3
	Application Server.  In that plugin module, you implemented the
	<code>ConsoleProvider @Contract interface</code>, and annotated your
	implementation with the <code>@Service</code> annotation.  This allowed
	the GlassFish v3 / HK2 environment to discover your plugin module,
	making it available to the GlassFish Administration Console.  Your
	<code>ConsoleProvider</code> implementation referenced your
	<code>console-config.xml</code> file, which in turn declared an
	<code>IntegrationPoint</code> enabling you to add a tree node to the
	GlassFish Administration Console.  From this tree node, you created a
	link to your "Hello World!" page.  Well done!</p>

    <p>	Below is a picture of what Exercise 1 looked like at its completion.</p>

    <p> &nbsp;</p>
    <p class="j1holheader">Exercise 2:</p>

    <p>	In Exercise 2, you learned out to use jMaki Charting.  You created
	another JSFTemplating page, and another tree node.  You integrated
	these into the GlassFish Administration Console by defining another
	IntegrationPoint, this time using your previous IntegrationPoint as
	the parent. This exercise demonstrated how easy it is to bring
	graphing to the GlassFish Administration Console, or to any
	application by leveraging jMaki. Congratulations!</p>

    <p>	The result of Exercise 2 is shown in the image below.</p>

    <p> &nbsp;</p>
    <p class="j1holheader">Exercise 3:</p>

    <p>	In Exercise 3, you learned how to use Facelets-style templating to
	allow the template to specify parts of your page that don't change,
	while allowing you provide content.  This technique greatly reduces
	the effort required to maintain your content as it is less mixed
	with ordinary template text.  For the GlassFish Administration
	Console, it provide a convenient way for the infrastructure of a
	page, and its look and feel, to be provided automatically.</p>

    <p>	Additionally in the Exercise, you learned how to make use of
	JSFTemplating handlers to perform actions during events.  You were
	able to retrieve random data from the server to generate dynamic
	charts, and you were able to modify the look of the charts via a
	drop-down menu.  This menu demonstrated multiple charting frameworks,
	however, you <b>did not</b> need to learn multiple charting
	frameworks -- you only need to learn jMaki.</p>

    <p>	This lab also had you integrate your plugin as in the previous labs.
	You created your 3rd tree node and gained experience in configuring
	IntegrationPoints in the GlassFish Administration Console.  Great
	job getting this far!</p>

    <p>	The result of Exercise 3 is shown in the image below.</p>

    <p class="j1holheader">Get Involved!</p>

    <p>	Now that you have completed this Hands-on Lab, you have gain a
	significant amount of experience integrating into GlassFish v3.  What
	are you going to do what that experience?  The GlassFish community
	welcomes you to participate!  You are encouraged to file bugs,
	recommend features you would like to see.  You can integrate your
	person, or company products and services into the GlassFish platform
	and share it with the rest of the community.  You are welcome to take
	GlassFish technology as a whole, or in pieces to help you in your
	day-to-day work, or your weekend hobby.  You are invited to meet with
	the GlassFish developers during planning meetings, day-to-day on IRC,
	or on email or Forums.</p>

    <p>	To learn more about how you can meet the people behind GlassFish, or to
	become a "person behind GlassFish", visit some of the sites below.
	Also come visit at the GlassFish booths at JavaOne or other
	conferences.</p>
