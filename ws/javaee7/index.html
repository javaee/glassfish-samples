<p>
The Java BluePrints are part of the java.net community.
Refer to <a href="https://blueprints.dev.java.net/">blueprints.dev.java.net</a>
for more information.  BluePrints are also installed as part of the Java EE SDK.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="http://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/tutorial/doc/index.html">Java
EE Tutorial</a> is available for download and browsing online.</p>

<h2>Setting Up Your Environment</h2>
Make sure you have downloaded and installed <a
 href="http://java.sun.com/javaee/downloads/">Java EE SDK</a> or <a
 href="https://glassfish.dev.java.net/">GlassFish</a>.<br>
<br>
Before working with the sample applications, you must set up
Application Server environment.
Follow the basic steps in the <a href="docs/UserREADME.html">Common
Build Instructions for Sample Applications</a>&nbsp; to configure
your environment.
<h2>Using Databases with the Samples</h2>
<p>
Some sample applications require a database.
You can use any JDBC-compliant database, but setup scripts and
instructions are provided for Java DB.
The Java DB database is installed with Java EE 6 SDK.
It includes a pre-populated database containing tables and data for
the sample applications. For more information, see <a
 href="docs/JavaDB.html">Using Java DB with the Samples</a>. </p>
<h2>Getting Help</h2>
<p>If you encounter problems while running the samples,write to the <a
 href="http://forums.java.net/jive/forum.jspa?forumID=56&amp;start=0">GlassFish
discussion forum</a>.
