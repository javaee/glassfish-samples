<h1>The Managed Beans Application</h1>
<p>This sample demonstrates the Java EE 6 feature of managed beans. JAX-RS root
   resource classes are annotated with @ManagedBean, which means EE-related resources
   may be injected into instances of those classes.
</p>
<p>If configured properly, page http://localhost:8080/managed-beans-war
will be opened after
invoking the
<code>run</code> target. </p>
<p>The mapping of the URI path space is presented in the following
table:</p>
<table border="1">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>URI path</th>
      <th>Resource class</th>
      <th>HTTP method</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>/managed-beans-war</td>
      <td>---</td>
      <td>GET</td>
      <td>index page</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>/managed-beans-war/app/managedbean/per-request</td>
      <td>ManagedBeanPerRequestResource</td>
      <td>GET</td>
      <td>Returns injected value and increments it</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>/managed-beans-war/app/managedbean/singleton</td>
      <td>ManagedBeanSingletonResource</td>
      <td>GET</td>
      <td>Returns injected value and increments it</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<h2>Application Structure</h2>
<p> The application is built and deployed as a WAR file.
</p>
<h3>Web Module</h3>
<p> The web module consists of: </p>
<ul>
  <li>HTML index page </li>
  <li>Two root resource classes that are managed beans and one stateless session bean. One root resource class is managed in the default JAX-RS life-cyle of per-request and the other is managed in the lifecycle of singleton (meaning on instance per web application).</li>
</ul>
The starting point of the application is the <code>index.html</code>
page. The application consists only from two resources
and main page provides links to them. Two EE-related artifacts are injected into each root resource class instance.
            The first is a resource constant defined in the web.xml:

<pre>
&lt;env-entry&gt;
    &lt;env-entry-name&gt;injectedResource&lt;/env-entry-name&gt;
    &lt;env-entry-type&gt;java.lang.Integer&lt;/env-entry-type&gt;
    &lt;env-entry-value&gt;<b>1</b>&lt;/env-entry-value&gt;
&lt;/env-entry&gt;
</pre>

            The second is a stateless session EJB (see class enterprise.managedbeans.resources.StatelessSessionBean).

The output is message provided by injected StatelessSessionBean instance concatenated with injected integer value from web.xml. You can easily test if singleton is really singleton by hitting that resource class more than once - integer value should increment by one every time you hit it. On the other hand, per-request resource will always return "message 1" (the value is incremented too, but same per-request instance wouldn't be hit twice).

<h2>Building, Deploying, and Running the Application</h2>
<p><!-- &lt;replacement for asant procedure&gt;<br> -->
Perform the following steps to build, deploy, and run the
application:<br>
</p>
<ol>
  <li> Setup your build environment and configure the application
server with which the build system has to work by following the <a
 href="../../../docs/UserREADME.html">
common build instructions.</a></li>
  <li><code><i>app_dir</i></code> is the sample application base
directory: <code><i>samples_install_dir</i>/javaee6/rest/managed-beans-war</code>.</li>
  <li><code></code><code></code>Change directory to <code><i>app_dir.<br>
    </i></code></li>
  <li>Build, deploy, and run the sample application using the <code>all</code>
target.<code></code></li>
  <p><code><span style="font-style: italic;">app_dir&gt; </span>ant
all</code><br>
  </p>
  <p>You can replace the <code>ant all</code> command with the
following set of
commands:<br>
  </p>
  <p><code><span style="font-style: italic;">app_dir&gt; </span>ant
default</code> compiles and packages the application </p>
  <p><code><span style="font-style: italic;">app_dir&gt; </span>ant
deploy</code> deploys it to application server </p>
  <li>Use the target clean to undeploy the sample application and to
remove the temporary directories like build and dist.
    <p><code><span style="font-style: italic;">app_dir&gt; </span>ant
clean</code> </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Building, Deploying, and Running the Application in NetBeans IDE</h2>
<p>Perform the following steps to build, deploy, and run the
application using NetBeans IDE:
</p>
<ol>
  <li> Refer to the <a href="../../../docs/UserREADME.html"> common
build instructions</a> for setting up NetBeans IDE and Java EE 6 SDK.</li>
  <li> In the NetBeans IDE, choose File &#8594; Open Project
(Ctrl-Shift-O), navigate to the <code><i>samples_install_dir</i>/javaee6/rest/</code> directory, select <code>managed-beans-war</code>, and click Open Project.</li>
  <li> In the Projects tab, right click <code>managed-beans-war</code> and
select Run to build, deploy, and run the project.<br>
If configured properly, the IDE opens the browser with the following
URL: <code>http://localhost:8080/managed-beans-war</code>.
    <br>
Sample output is as follows:<br>
    <b>NetBeans IDE output</b>
    <pre>init:<br>deps-module-jar:<br>deps-ear-jar:<br>deps-jar:<br>library-inclusion-in-archive:<br>library-inclusion-in-manifest:<br>compile:<br>compile-jsps:<br>Starting GlassFish v3 Prelude<br>GlassFish v3 Prelude is running.<br>Incrementally deploying managed-beans-war<br>Completed incremental distribution of managed-beans-war<br>run-deploy:<br>Browsing: http://localhost:8080/managed-beans-war/<br>run-display-browser:<br>run:<br>BUILD SUCCESSFUL (total time: 11 seconds)</pre>
    <b>Browser output</b>
    <div style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 5px;">
