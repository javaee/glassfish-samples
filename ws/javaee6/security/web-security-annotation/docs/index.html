<h1>Servlet 3.0 Web Security Annotations Sample</h1>
This is a simple web application that demonstrates the access control
annotations in servlets.<br>
<h2>Access Control Annotations</h2>
<p>
The <code>@RolesAllowed</code>, <code>@DenyAll</code>, <code>@PermitAll</code>,
and <code>@TransportProtected</code>
annotations provide an alternative mechanism for defining security
constraints equivalent to those that could otherwise have been
expressed declaratively in the portable deployment descriptor. These
annotations are defined in the Common Annotations for the Java
Platform specification (JSR 250). Servlet containers are required to
support the use of these annotations within classes (and subclasses
thereof) that implement the javax.servlet.Servlet interface and for
which the Servlet container would process security- constaints if they
were specified in web.xml.
</p>
<h2>AnnotationServlet</h2>
<p>
The <code>@PermitAll</code> method is applied on the servlet class and
is applicable
to all the methods. However, this is overridden by the method-specific
annotations: <code>@RolesAllowed</code>, defined on the <code>doGet()</code>
method
and
<code>@DenyAll</code> defined on the <code>doPost()</code> method. The
<code>@DeclareRoles</code> annotation
is used to specify the roles applicable to the servlet.
A single role, <code>javaee6user</code> is defined and is configured
to allow
<code>doGet()</code> method, while <code>doPost()</code> is precluded
from access by any user.
</p>
<h2>Building, Deploying, and Running the Application</h2>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Perform the following steps to build, deploy, and run the
application:<br>
<br>
</p>
<ol>
  <li> Setup your build environment and configure the application
server with which the build system has to work by following the <a
 href="../../../docs/UserREADME.html">
common build instructions.</a></li>
  <li><code><i>app_dir</i></code> is the sample application base
directory: <code><i>samples_install_dir</i>/javaee6/security/web-security-annotation</code>.</li>
  <li><code></code><code></code>Change directory to <code><i>app_dir.<br>
    </i></code></li>
  <li>Open the browser and clear the browser cache.</li>
  <li>Build, deploy, and run the sample application:<code></code></li>
  <p><code><span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; app_dir&gt; </span>ant <br>
  </code></p>
  <li>
    <p>The launch target opens the browser. Try the Get method to see a
challenge posed to the user to enter username/password.Enter
javaee6user/abc123 (the configured file-user for role javaee6user). Try
the post method to check that all users are denied access.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Use the target <code>clean</code> to undeploy the sample
application and to remove the temporary directories like build and
dist.
    <p><code><span style="font-style: italic;">app_dir&gt; </span>ant
clean</code> </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Building, Deploying, and Running the Application in NetBeans IDE</h2>
<p>
Follow these instructions to build, deploy, and run
this sample application using NetBeans IDE.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Download and install Netbeans IDE 6.7. For setting up NetBeans
IDE
and the application server, see the <a
 href="../../../docs/UserREADME.html">
common build instructions</a>. <a href="../../../docs/UserREADME.html"><br>
    </a></li>
  <li> In NetBeans IDE, select File-&gt;OpenProject and select <code><i>install_dir</i>/samples/security/web-security-annotation</code>
as the project.</li>
  <li>Access the Admin Console of the server (http://localhost:4848)
and go to the Security-&gt;Realms-&gt;FileRealm node in the tree.</li>
  <li>Click the Manage Users button on the Edit Realm page to add a new
user (UserID, Group List - javaee6user, password - abc123)</li>
  <li> Right-click <code>web-security-annotation</code> and select <code>Run
Project</code>, which will build, deploy and run the project.</li>
  <p>Try the Get method to see a
challenge posed to the user to enter username/password.Enter
javaee6user/abc123 (the configured file-user for role javaee6user). Try
the post method to check that all users are denied access. </p>
</ol>
<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
