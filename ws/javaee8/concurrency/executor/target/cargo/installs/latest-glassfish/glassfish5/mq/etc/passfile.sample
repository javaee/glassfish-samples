#
# This file is an example of a passfile.
#
# A passfile is used to store passwords so that the same passwords
# do not have to be entered on the command line or as an interactive
# response to a system prompt for a password.
#
# Note that directly entering a password on the command line has been
# removed beginning with the MQ 4.0 release.
#
# i.e. the use of the -p or -password option is removed
#
# e.g.
# % imqcmd ............. -u <username> -p <password>
# 
# The above command line operation no longer accepts the -p option.
# However, the -passfile option can be used in it's place as shown below.
#
# e.g.
# % imqcmd ............. -u <username> -passfile <password_filename>
# 
# 
# After you add password(s) to a passfile,  you should run
#
# imqusermgr encode -src <original-passfile> -target <new-passfile> 
#
# to encode the password(s) in the passfile and save the <new-passfile>
# for MQ command line use.  The <new-passfile> is not encrypted, so you
# should set the file permissions to protected it from unauthorized access.
# Alternatively, when you interactively enter a command you can let the 
# system prompt you for a password. 
#
# The following passwords can be stored in a passfile --
# 
#   o keystore password
#   o LDAP repository password
#   o JDBC database password
#   o imqcmd password
#   o broker bridge service manager administrator password
#
#
# Using a passfile
# ----------------
#
# A passfile is used in the following cases --
# 
#   o By the broker when the broker is configured to do so.
#
#   o By a MQ command when the -passfile option is specified
#
#
# To configure the broker to use a passfile, do one of the following: 
#
#    o Set the following properties in the broker config.properties file:
#          imq.passfile.enabled=true
#          imq.passfile.dirpath=<directory of the file e.g. ${imq.etchome}>
#          imq.passfile.name=<name of the passfile>
# 
#    o Use the -passfile option of the broker:  
#	   imqbrokerd -passfile <full name of the encoded passfile>
#
#
#
#
# A passfile can contain the following passwords: 
#
#       imq.keystore.password
#                - Opens the SSL keystore  
# 
#       imq.user_repository.ldap.password
#                - Used to connect securely with an LDAP
#                  directory if the connection is not anonymous
# 
#       imq.persist.jdbc.password
#                - Used to connect with a JDBC database
#              
#       imq.imqcmd.password
#                - Used to perform broker administration tasks
#                  using imqcmd
#
#       imq.bridge.admin.password
#                - Used by the broker's bridge service manager
#
#
# You add password in name=value format to a passfile, for example:
#
#       imq.keystore.password=<keystore password>
#       imq.user_repository.ldap.password=<ldap user repository password>
#       imq.persist.jdbc.password=<jdbc password>
#       imq.imqcmd.password=<administrator password>
#       imq.bridge.admin.password=<administrator password for bridge service manager>
#
# 
#---------------------------------------------------------------------
# The keystore password when the broker is configured to use SSL.
# A dummy password has been configured as an example.
#

imq.keystore.password=mypassword

#
#---------------------------------------------------------------------
# The administration password for broker administration tasks using imqcmd
# A dummy password has been configured as an example
# 

imq.imqcmd.password=myadminpassword

#
# Note: imqcmd is a remote administration tool. A passfile used by 
# the broker can also be used by imqcmd only if it is accessible 
# from where imqcmd is executed. This may not be possible if imqcmd 
# is run from a machine that is remote relative to the broker.
