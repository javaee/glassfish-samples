        <h1>The TransactionScoped Annotation CDI Sample Application</h1>
        <p>This sample application uses the <code>@TransactionScoped</code> annotation on a bean 
		   and injects this bean within a transactional context.</p>

        <h2>Description</h2>
<p>This demo uses a servlet to inject two beans annotated with the <code>@TransactionScoped</code> annotation. 
   The example is divided in three scenarios:</p>
   
<ul>
<li>Scenario 1 demonstrates that all injections of a bean within a single transaction use the same bean instance.</li>
<li>Scenario 2 demonstrates that injections of a bean in different transactions use different bean instances.</li>
<li>Scenario 3 demonstrates that beans annotated with the <code>@TransactionScoped</code> annotation must be invoked
    within a transactional context.</li>
</ul>

<p>User can click on the submit button in provided index.html or invoke servlet at <code>http://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/&lt;context-root&gt;/TransactionScopedServlet</code> runs the three scenarios and
   presents the result as HTML output.</p>

        <h2>Building, Deploying, and Running the Application</h2>
        <!-- Modify this section as needed -->
        <p>Perform the following steps to build, deploy, and run the application:</p>
        <ol>
            <li> Set up your build environment and configure the application server with which the build system has to work by following the <a href="../../../docs/UserREADME.html">common build instructions.</a></li>
            <li><code><i>app_dir</i></code> is the sample application base directory: <code><i>samples_install_dir</i>/javaee7/cdi/transaction-scoped</code>.</li>
            <li>Change directory to <code><i>app_dir.</i></code></li>
            <li>Build, deploy, and run the sample application using the <code>run</code> outcome.
                <p><code>mvn clean verify cargo:run</code></p>
            </li>
            <li>Use the <code>clean</code> outcome to undeploy the sample application and to remove the temporary directories such as <code>build</code> and <code>dist</code>.
                <p><code>mvn clean</code></p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
        <p>If you have problems when running the application, refer to the <a href="../../../docs/UserTroubleShooting.html">troubleshooting document</a>.</p>
