        <h1>The JavaServer Faces CDI Sample Application</h1>
        <p>This sample application demonstrates how to use CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection) with JavaServer Faces.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This sample application gives you 10 attempts to guess a number between 1 an 100. After each attempt, the application tells you whether your guess was too high
		   or too low.</p>

        <p>The example consists of two qualifiers, an application scopped bean, and a session-scoped bean:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>The <code>@Random</code> qualifier injects a random number.</li>
          <li>The <code>@MaxNumber</code> qualifier injects the maximum number allowed.</li>
		  <li>The application-scoped <code>Generator</code> bean generates a random number and the maximum number using producer methods.</li>
		  <li>The session-scoped <code>Game</code> bean sets up or resets the game, captures and validates the user's guess, and provides feedback with a <code>FacesMessage</code>. This bean
		  is the primary entry point of the application.</li>
		</ul>
	
        <h2>Building, Deploying, and Running the Application</h2>
        <!-- Modify this section as needed -->
        <p>Perform the following steps to build, deploy, and run the application:</p>
        <ol>
            <li> Set up your build environment and configure the application server with which the build system has to work by following the <a href="../../../docs/UserREADME.html">common build instructions.</a></li>
            <li><code><i>app_dir</i></code> is the sample application base directory: <code><i>samples_install_dir</i>/javaee8/cdi/cdi-guess</code>.</li>
            <li>Change directory to <code><i>app_dir.</i></code></li>
            <li>Build, deploy, and run the sample application using the <code>run</code> outcome.
                <p><code>mvn clean verify cargo:run</code></p>
            </li>
            <li>Use the <code>clean</code> outcome to undeploy the sample application and to remove the temporary directories such as <code>build</code> and <code>dist</code>.
                <p><code>mvn clean</code></p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
        <p>If you have problems when running the application, refer to the <a href="../../../docs/UserTroubleShooting.html">troubleshooting document</a>.</p>
