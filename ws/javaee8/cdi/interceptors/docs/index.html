        <h1>The Interceptors CDI Sample Application</h1>
        <p>CDI Interceptors intercept on invocations and lifecycle events on 
an associated target class.  An interceptor is a class whose 
methods are invoked when business methods on the target class are 
invoked and/or when lifecycle events such as calls that create/destroy 
the bean occur. Interceptors are typically used to implement 
cross-cutting concerns like logging, auditing, and profiling.</p>

        <h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This sample illustrates how interceptors can be added to a CDI bean that mimics a shopping cart.
The demo uses a <code>ShoppingServlet</code> to add items to the cart. The cart itself
is injected as a CDI bean and has a class-level interceptor which ensures that
the interceptor is applied to all methods of the bean. The interceptor (<code>LoggingInterceptorSimple</code>) is enabled
in <code>WEB-INF/beans.xml</code> and prints the method name being invoked. 
</p>
<p>An alternative 
interceptor implementation (commented out in <code>beans.xml</code>) is also available and
may be enabled instead of or in addition to the existing interceptor.
</p>

<p>The code snippet below shows the definition of <code>LoggingInterceptor</code>.
The <code>@AroundInvoke</code> annotation (only one per interceptor) on a method 
in the interceptor class ensures that this method is invoked around the 
business method interception. 
</p>

<pre>
@LoggingInterceptor
@Interceptor
public class LoggingInterceptorSimple {
    @AroundInvoke
    public Object log(InvocationContext context) throws Exception {
        System.out.println("LOG: " + context.getMethod());
        return context.proceed();
    }
}
</pre>

        <h2>Building, Deploying, and Running the Application</h2>
        <!-- Modify this section as needed -->
        <p>Perform the following steps to build, deploy, and run the application:</p>
        <ol>
            <li> Set up your build environment and configure the application server with which the build system has to work by following the <a href="../../../docs/UserREADME.html">common build instructions.</a></li>
            <li><code><i>app_dir</i></code> is the sample application base directory: <code><i>samples_install_dir</i>/javaee8/cdi/interceptors</code>.</li>
            <li>Change directory to <code><i>app_dir.</i></code></li>
            <li>Build, deploy, and run the sample application using the <code>run</code> outcome.
                <p><code>mvn clean verify cargo:run</code></p>
            </li>
            <li>Use the <code>clean</code> outcome to undeploy the sample application and to remove the temporary directories such as <code>build</code> and <code>dist</code>.
                <p><code>mvn clean</code></p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
        <p>If you have problems when running the application, refer to the <a href="../../../docs/UserTroubleShooting.html">troubleshooting document</a>.</p>
