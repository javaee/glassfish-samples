<h1>The Automatic Timer EJB Sample Application (Test Client)</h1>
<p>This is the standalone Java client for a simple EJB module that demonstrates how to use the EJB automatic timer.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This sample application consists of two parts: an <a href="../../automatic-timer-server/docs/index.html">EJB module</a> and a 
test client (this project). The rest of this document describes the test client.</p>

<p>
<code>AutomaticTimerJavaClient</code> is a client that runs outside of a Java EE container.
In this case, the client performs a global JNDI lookup since dependency injection is not
available outside of a Java EE environment.
</p>

<p><b>Standalone Java Client</b></p>

<pre>
public class AutomaticTimerJavaClient {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        try {
            StatelessSession sless = (StatelessSession)
                                      ic.lookup("java:global/automatic-timer-ejb/StatelessSessionBean");
            System.out.println("Waiting for the timer to expire");
            Thread.sleep(7000);
            List&lt;String&gt; result = sless.getRecords();
            System.out.println("Got " + result.size() + " log records:");
            for (String s : result) {
                System.out.println(s);
            }
        } catch(Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
</pre>

<h2>Building, Deploying, and Running the Java Client<br></h2>
<p>Since this is the client of <code>automatic-timer-server</code>, so please first go to <code><i>samples_install_dir</i>/javaee8/ejb/automatic-timer/automatic-timer-server</code>, and run the instructions described in section "Building, Deploying, and Running the Application" in <a href="../../automatic-timer-server/docs/index.html">the sample's document</a>. <br><br>Following are the instructions for building and running
the Java Client.<br>
<br>
</p>
<ol>
  <li> Setup your build environment and Configure the application
server with which the build system has to work by following the <a href="../../../../docs/UserREADME.html">
common build instructions.</a></li>
  <li><code><i>app_dir</i></code> is the sample application base
directory: <code><i>samples_install_dir</i>/javaee8/ejb/automatic-timer/automatic-timer-client</code>.</li>
  <li><code></code><code></code>Change directory to <code><i>app_dir.</i></code></li>
  <li>Make sure that the database has been started up and the project automatic-timer-server has been built and deployed. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Build and Run the standalone client.<p><code>mvn clean verify exec:java</code></p></li>
</ol>
<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>If you have problems when running the application, refer to the <a href="../../../../docs/UserTroubleShooting.html">troubleshooting document</a>.</p>
