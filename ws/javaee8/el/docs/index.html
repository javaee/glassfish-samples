        <h1>The Expression Language Sample Application</h1>
        <p>This sample demonstrates some of the new features in Expression Language (EL) 3.0.</p>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=341">
        Expression Language 3.0 (JSR 341)</a> includes many new features. This sample
        contains Java code that illustrates how expressions can be evaluated in a
        stand-alone environment, outside of a web container.  It also includes
        examples of some the new syntax in EL expressions, as detailed in
        <a href="#KeyFeatures">Key Features</a> below.</p>

        <h2><a name="KeyFeatures">Key Features</h2>
		<p>This sample demonstrates the following key features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Support for a standalone environment</li>
            <li>Static field or method references</li>
            <li>New operators: concatenation, semicolon, and assignment</li>
            <li>Lambda expressions</li>
            <li>Collection constructions and operations</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Building, Deploying, and Running the Application</h2>
        <p>The sample runs without a web container. Perform the following steps to clean, build and run the application:</p>
        <ol>
		    <li>Change directory to <code><i>samples_install_dir</i>/el</code></li>
            <li>Execute the following command:
                <p><code>mvn clean compile exec:java</code></p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
        <p>If you have problems when running the application, refer to the <a href="../../docs/UserTroubleShooting.html">troubleshooting document</a>.</p>
