        <h1>The MailConnector Resource Adapter Sample Application</h1>
		<p>This sample application demonstrates how to develop a resource adapter (RA) and deploy connector resources with annotations defined
		in the Java EE Connector Architecture 1.7 specification. The application uses the mail connector resource adapter to retrieve e-mails.
		The mail connector resource adapter is completely built by specifying annotations; no deployment descriptor is used.</p>
		


    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Mail Connector sample application consists of 4 maven projects:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="#ear">mailconnector-ear</a> is the Java EE enterprise application which contains the following 3 JavaEE modules.</li>
        <li><a href="#ra">mailconnector-ra</a> is an embedded resource adapter module that facilitates communication between the JavaEE application and the mail server.</li>
        <li><a href="#mdb">mailconnector-mdb</a> is an EJB module that contains a message-driven bean (MDB). This MDB exercises the Inbound connector.</li>
        <li><a href="#web">mailconnector-web</a> is a web module that enables the user to send email messages and query for new messages on a given mailbox folder.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The MailConnector Resource Adapter enables the MDB to receive
        email messages that are delivered to a specific mailbox folder on a
        given mail server. It also provides connection factory objects that
        clients can use to obtain connection objects that allow them to
        synchronously query email servers for new messages on a given mailbox
        folder.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <code>onMessage()</code>
        method of the MDB uses the JavaMail API to send a reply acknowledging
        the receipt of the message, which verifies that the process is
        working. This code has been commented out to avoid sending undesired
        replies when you are testing with a busy mailbox. Instead, relevant
        information about the received message is dumped to the standard
        output and you can see it in the server logs. 
    </p>
    <h3><a name="ra"></a>The MailConnector Resource Adapter&nbsp;: mailconnector-ra </h3>
    <p>
        The components of the resource adapter are archived into a file named
        <code>mailconnector.rar</code>
        that contains Java classes and error message files.
    </p>
    <p>Because this is a annotated rar, it does not have a connector
        descriptor file (<code>ra.xml</code>). It is also possible to have the <code>ra.xml</code> file along
        with the annotated <code>.rar</code> file.</p>
    <h4>MailConnector RAR File</h4>
    <p>
        The
        <code>mailconnector.rar</code>
        file contains the Java interfaces, classes, error messages and resource
        files that make up the resource adapter. You can modify the resource
        file,
        <code>LocalStrings.properties</code>
        , for localization.
    </p>
    <p>
        The source code for these components is in
        <code>
            mailconnector/mailconnector-ra/src/main/java/samples/connectors/mailconnector
        </code>
        , in the following sub-directories:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>ra</code>: the base class of the MailConnector RA.</li>
        <li><code>ra/inbound</code>: classes that implement the inbound
            part of the MailConnector.</li>
        <li><code>ra/outbound</code>: classes implement the outbound part
            of the MailConnector.</li>
        <li><code>api</code>: interfaces that MDBs associated with this
            RA are required to implement and the <code>Connection</code> and <code>ConnectionFactory</code>
            interfaces provided by the outbound resource adapter.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Annotated Resource-Adapter Artifacts</h4>
    <p>
        The following resource-adapter classes are annotated to represent
        various artifacts of the resource-adapter:<br> <br>
    
    <table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
        <tbody>
            <tr align="center">
                <th>Resource Adapter Class</th>
                <th>Annotation used</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><code>samples.connectors.mailconnector.ra.ResourceAdapterImpl</code>
                </td>
                <td><code>@Connector</code> annotation to represent the
                    resource-adapter.<br> <code>@AuthenticationMechanism</code>
                    annotation to provide the authentication mechanism requirement.<br>
                    <code>@SecurityPermission</code> annotation to provide the security
                    permission requirement.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><code>samples.connectors.mailconnector.ra.outbound.ManagedConnectionFactoryImpl</code>
                </td>
                <td><code>@ConnectionDefinition</code> annotation to represent
                    a connection definition with managed-connection-factory,
                    connection-factory artifact details.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><code>samples.connectors.mailconnector.ra.inbound.ActivationSpecImpl</code>
                </td>
                <td><code>@Activation</code> annotation to represent the
                    activation-spec and the message-listener artifact details.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><code>All the annotated classes</code></td>
                <td><code>@ConfigProperty</code> annotation to represent config
                    properties of the Java Bean</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    </p>
    <h4>The Polling Thread of the Inbound Connector</h4>
    <p>When the MailConnector resource adapter is deployed, it uses the
        Work Management facilities available to resource adapters to start a
        thread that monitors mailbox folders for new messages. When a new
        message arrives to a folder, the <code>PollingThread</code> instantiates a
        <code>DeliveryThread</code> that forwards the message to the appropriate
        message-driven bean.</p>
    <p>The information needed by the <code>PollingThread</code> to monitor a
        specific folder (username, password, server name, and folder name) is
        specified by the MDB assembler via the the activation configuration
        properties of the MDB deployment descriptor. When an MDB is deployed,
        the Application Server passes the MDB's activation configuration
        information to the MailConnector resource adapter, which in turn
        forwards it to the <code>PollingThread</code>. When the MDB is undeployed, the
        Application Server notifies the RA, and then the MailConnector RA
        notifies the <code>PollingThread</code>, so that it stops monitoring the the mail
        folder associated with the MDB being undeployed. When the RA is
        undeployed, the <code>PollingThread</code> is terminated.</p>
    <p>
        The <code>PollingThread</code> source code is located at
        <code>
            mailconnector/mailconnector-ra/src/main/java/samples/connectors/mailconnector/ra/inbound
        </code>
        
    </p>
    <h3><a name="mdb"></a>The Message-Driven Bean(MDB): mailconnector-mdb</h3>
    <p>The MailConnector application contains a message-driven bean(MDB) that consumes new mails through the MailConnector Resource Adapter.</p>
    <p>
        The source code for these components is in the following sub-directories:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>mailconnector/mailconnector-mdb/src/main/resources/META-INF</code>: contains application deployment descriptor files.</li>
        <li><code>mailconnector/mailconnector-mdb/src/main/java/samples/connectors/mailconnector/ejb/mdb</code>:
            contains source code for the MDB. The <code>onMessage</code> method of this MDB 
            consumes email messages sent to a mailbox folder. The mailbox folder is described through the annotation
            <code>@ActivationConfigProperty</code> defined in <code>@MessageDriven</code>.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3><a name="web"></a>The Web Application: mailconnector-web</h3>
    <p>The MailConnector application contains a Web application that enables the user to send email
        messages (any mail client can be used for this purpose), and it also
        allows the user to query for new messages on a given mailbox folder by
        means of a JSP/Servlet pair that uses the synchronous features of the
        MailConnector to perform this task.</p>
    <p>
        The source code for these components is in the following sub-directories:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>mailconnector/mailconnector-web/src/main/java</code>: contains the <code> SendMailServlet </code> 
        and the <code> MailBrowserServlet </code> servlets.</li>
        <li><code>mailconnector/mailconnector-web/src/main/webapp/</code>: contains the main HTML
            page of the Web application and two JSP pages. The JSP pages enable
            users to send email messages to a given mailbox folder and query for
            new messages in a mail folder using the connection interfaces
            provided through the MailConnector resource adapter.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Annotated Artifacts</h4>
    <p>
        The following servlets are annotated to define resources:<br>
    
    <table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
        <tbody>
            <tr align="center">
                <th>Servlet</th>
                <th>Annotation used</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><code>samples.connectors.mailconnector.servlet.SendMailServlet</code> </td>
                <td><code>@MailSessionDefinition</code> annotation to define a maill session resource which is used to build and send a mail message.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><code>samples.connectors.mailconnector.servlet.MailBrowserServlet</code></td>
                <td><code>@ConnectionFactoryDefinition</code> annotation to define a connector resource which is used to create a connection.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    </p>
	
	
    <h2>Mail Server</h2>
	<p>The sample application uses a mock <a href="https://mock-javamail.java.net/">JavaMail</a> implementation.
	The mock JavaMail implementation does not communicate with an mail server. Instead, it simulates a mail server
	using an in-memory mailbox. For the sake of convenience, this sample project contains its jar library which is
	located at <code>mailconnector/lib/mock-javamail-1.12.jar</code>. User can directly copy this jar file to the
	<code>glassfish/lib</code> directory of your Glassfish installation, and do not have to download and build the 
	mock JavaMail project from source files.</p>
	
	For those who want to build the mock JavaMail from source, please follow these steps:
	<ol>
	<li>
	Download the sources for mock JavaMail using the following command::<br>
	<code>svn checkout https://svn.java.net/svn/mock-javamail~svn/trunk/mock-javamail</code>
	</li>
	<li>
	Compile the sources using the following command:<br>
	<code>mvn clean install</code><br>
	This command generates the JAR file in <code>target/mock-javamail-&lt;version&gt;.jar</code>
	</li>
	</ol>
    
    <h2>Configuration</h2>
    <p>
        <b>Note</b>:The pre-built EAR file provided with this sample contains an MDB with generic property values
        that corresponds to the email folder of user <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">joe</span></span>.
        If you intend to change the user, rebuild the EAR file before deploying this application.
    </p>
    <p>Follow these steps to configure the application:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The MDB class <code>samples.connectors.mailconnector.ejb.mdb.JavaMailMessageBean</code> 
        defines the following properties using the <code>@ActivationConfigProperty</code> annotation:<br/><br/>
            <ul>
                <li>serverName: localhost</li>
                <li>userName: joe</li>
                <li>password: joe</li>
                <li>folderName: name of the mail folder associated
                    with the MDB (Inbox by default)</li>
                <li>protocol: must be "imap"</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>If you wish, edit these properties. These properties enable the MDB to send email messages.&nbsp;
        </li>
    </ol>
	
	<h2>Key Features</h2>
	<p>The MailConnector sample application demonstrates the following key features:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>How to create a resource adapter (RA) according to the Java EE Connector Architecture 1.6 Specification by annotating the resource adapter artifacts.</li>
	  <li>How to deploy such RAs to the Application Server.</li>
	  <li>How resource adapters interact with other Java EE application components.</li>
	  <li>How to use resouce adapter's (RA) outbound artifacts.</li>
	  <li>How to use resource adapter's (RA) inbound artifacts.</li>
	  <li>How to use the <code>WorkContext</code> (eg: <code>SecurityContext</code>) features introduced in Java EE Connector Architecture 1.6 Specification to flow in contextual information from external systems (EIS) to the application server (applications).</li>
	  <li>How to define a connector resource in a Web module according to the Java EE Connector Architecture 1.7 Specification through the <code>@ConnectionFactoryDefinition</code> annotation. </li>
	  <li>How to define a mail session resource in a Web module according to the Java EE 8 specification with the <code>@MailSessionDefinition</code> annotation. </li>

        </li>
        <li>In order to install mock JavaMail library, copy the jar file of mock JavaMail to the <code>lib/</code> directory
        of GlassFish installation by executing the command:<br>
        <code>cp ../lib/mock-javamail-1.12.jar target/cargo/installs/latest-glassfish/glassfish4/glassfish/lib</code></li>
        <li>Use this command to start GlassFish and deploy the sample application :<br>
                <code>mvn cargo:start antrun:run</code>
        </li>
        <li>Use the following command to undeploy the sample application and stop GlassFish:<br>
                <code>mvn cargo:deployer-undeploy cargo:stop clean</code>
        </li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Testing the Outbound Resource Adapter</h2>
    <p>You can test the outbound resource adapter by running the MailConnector application.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Go to the following URL: <code>http://localhost:8080/mailconnector-web</code></p>
    <p>Use the menu to access the JSP pages that allow you to send
        email messages to an email mailbox and to check the
        same mailbox for new messages. The JSP pages use servlets
        to accomplish these tasks.</p>
    <p>Querying the mailbox is accomplished using the outbound resource adapter.</p>
    <h2>Testing the Inbound Resource Adapter&nbsp;(SecurityContext)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Access the following URL:
            <code>http://localhost:8080/mailconnector-web</code></li>
        <li>Click on <i>Send an email message</i></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Set the <i>From</i> field to <span
                style="font-style: italic;">tom@localhost</span></li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Set the <i>To</i> field to <span
                style="font-style: italic;">joe@localhost</span></li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Edit the subject and message</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Press send</li>
        </ul>
        <li>The message is sent to <span
            style="font-style: italic;">joe's</span> mail box.&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>The deployed resource-adapter has a polling thread that
            polls the user's (<span style="font-style: italic;">joe's</span>)
            mailbox periodically (every 30 seconds).
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>The thread checks for any new messages. If there are new messages,
                they will be scheduled for delivery.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Delivery is scheduled in the <span
                style="font-style: italic;">SecurityContext</span> ie.,
                in the context of the sender's identity.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>The Resource Adapter will create and submit a <span
                style="font-style: italic;">SecurityContext</span>
                representing the sender's identity. For simplicity, we
                have created the users and credentials in the GlassFish
                domain; the password is the same as the user name.
                The list of users is the following: 
				<span style="font-style: italic;">tom, mike, leo, george</span>.
            </li>
            <li>For every received message, the resource adapter
                schedules a delivery of the message to the MDB by submitting a <span
                style="font-style: italic;">work</span> instance.
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>The SecurityContext is set with sender's
                    id. The SecurityContext in this sample creates
                    a&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">PasswordValidationCallback</span>
                    with the sender's id and password.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>If the sender's id is a configured user in
                    GlassFish, the <span style="font-style: italic;">context

                    style="font-style: italic;">PasswordValidationCallback</span>
                    succeeds and the message is delivered to the MDB.
                </li>
                <li>If the sender's id is not configured, the <span
                    style="font-style: italic;">context setup</span> in
                    GlassFish fails, and the message is not delivered to the
                     MDB.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>When the message is delivered to the MDB, the MDB
                prints the <span style="font-style: italic;">caller-principal</span>
                &nbsp;of the delivered message using
				<code>MDBContext.getCallerPrincipal()</code>.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>The MDB logs the reception of messages in the
            application server log file with entries similar to these:</li>
    </ul>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
        <pre>&lt;MDB&gt; In JavaMailMessageBean.JavaMailMessageBean()</pre>
        <pre>&lt;MDB&gt; In JavaMailMessageBean.setMessageDrivenContext()</pre>
        <pre>&lt;MDB&gt; In JavaMailMessageBean.ejbCreate()</pre>
        <pre>[PT] scheduling a delivery FROM: joe::INBOX@localhost</pre>
        <pre>[SC] Password validation callback succeded for user : tom</pre>
        <pre>&lt;MDB&gt; ---- Got a message </pre>
        <pre>&lt;MDB&gt; SUBJECT: What's up</pre>
        <pre>&lt;MDB&gt; SENDER : tom@localhost</pre>
        <pre>&lt;MDB&gt; getCallerPrincipal() : tom</pre>
    </div>
    <p>You can also check the server log file and verify that the RA
        has started the <code>PollingThread</code> and that it has received the
        information corresponding to the deployed MDB.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The <code>PollingThread</code> log entries are preceded by <code>[PT]</code>
        </li>
        <li>The <code>PollingThread</code> helper class <code>EndpointConsumer</code> log
            entries are preceded by <code>[EC]</code>
        </li>
        <li>Resource adapter log entries are preceded by <code>[RA]</code></li>
        <li>The log entries related to the SecurityContext created per message delivery
            are preceded by <code>[SC]</code>
        </li>
        <li>The MDB log entries are preceded by <code>[MDB]</code>
        </li>
    </ul>
	<p>
    After deploying the EAR file containing the MDB, if there are
        no problems opening the mail folder associated with the MDB, you
        should see log entries similar to the following (with the
        appropriate values):
	</p>
    <p><pre>[EC] Created EndpointConsumer for: username::foldername@mailserver</pre></p>
    
    <p>After deploying the embedded RA, you should see log entries similar to the following
    (along with other log entries from the application server):</p>
    <p><pre>[PT] WorkManager started polling thread</pre></p>
    
    <p>By default, the <code>INFO</code> log level messages are printed.
    You can set the <code>FINEST</code> level of logging for the sample by executing the following command:</p>
    <pre>GF_HOME/bin/asadmin set-log-levels set-log-levels samples.connectors.mailconnector.ra=FINEST</pre>
    <pre>
    </pre>
