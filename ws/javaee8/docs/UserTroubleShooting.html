<h1>Troubleshooting Sample Applications</h1>
<br>
There are three components which contribute to the smooth working of
sample applications. These components are the build infrastructure,
the application server, and the sample application. Follow the <a
 href="UserREADME.html">common build instructions</a> to set up the
build infrastructure and the application server. To troubleshoot a sample
application, follow this procedure:
<ol>
  <li>
    Use the fine-grained Maven goals to isolate the problem. For example, if
	<code>mvn cargo:run</code> causes an exception then try to run the constituent
	Maven targets like <code>compile</code>, <code>install</code>,
	<code>verify</code>, and <code>cargo:run</code> separately.
  </li>
  <li>
    Refer to the exception in detail and try to fix it.
  </li>
  <li>
    Refer to the <code>server.log</code> file of the application server
	for clues or messages.
  </li>
  <li>
    Try alternative ways of doing the same thing. For example, if deployment fails,
	try deploying through the Admin Console or CLI.
  </li>
  <li>
    Before retrying, run the <code>clean</code> goal to remove the generated
	directories.
  </li>
  <li>
    Restart the application server. This might be needed to apply certain
	non-dynamic configuration changes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Make sure the user ID and password or the credentials are valid.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the application uses JDBC resources, make sure that the database server is up
	and running and the resources are set up properly. Likewise, if the application
	uses JMS resources, make sure the MQ server is running and the JMS resources are
	configured properly.
  </li>
  <li>
    The recommended version of Maven is 3.3+.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
The above list is evolving and is by no means exhaustive.
