<h1>The Hello-JAXWS Sample Application</h1>
This is a very simple JAX Web Service.  This sample demonstrates the lowest possible effort way to:
<ul>
<li>Write an Appclient that calls the Webservice
<li>connect and run the Webservice from the Appclient
</ul>
<br>
<h2> Configuration</h2>
The build script is designed to be easily moved anywhere else and modified.  To keep things as simple as possible it is <i>not</i> dependent on the
build framework in the Samples hierarchy.
<p>You do, however, have to setup some variables for Ant.  The easiest way to do this is to add 
these variables to <your-home>/build.properties (they are populated with sample values)
<p><code>
javaee.home=/as9<br>
javaee.server.name=localhost<br>
javaee.server.port=8080<br>
javaee.domaindir=/as9/domains/domain1<br>
</code>
<h2>How to use the build script</h2>
<ul>
<li>Start the App Server and make sure you have <home>/build.properties setup correctly.
<li>To do everything, simply run ant with no arguments
<li><b>ant get-artifacts</b> Gets the artifacts from the running Hello Webservice
<li><b>ant compile-client</b> Compiles the client
<li><b>ant run-client</b> Runs the Appclient
</ul>
<h2>Web Service</h2>
The webservice is in the xwss-bank-service project. Make sure it is deployed successfully 
before attempting to run the client.

<h2>The Web Client</h2>
This is an example of  a secure web service client.
In this example, a bank account JAX-WS webservice is sent securely 
using SOAP Message Security.
This is a scenario using X509 Mutual Authentication.
<br>
Client and Server are authenticated and messages integrity and 
confidentiality are provided by using Asymmetric Binding. 
The server X509 certificate is used as Recepient Token and the 
client X509 certificate is used as the Initiator Token.
<br>
All communication uses SOAP messages.
<br>
SignedParts and EncryptedParts assertions are present in the 
corresponding policy, indicating that the headers and Body of the message 
must be signed and encrypted. 

<h2>Deployment</h2>
<h2>Get Artifact files</H2>
In order to compile a client, we need some special files that the Hello Webservice will give us.
This is required so that the client has the webservice interfaces and ports available.
We use wsimport, an App Server-supplied program to do this like so:
<p>
<code>
${javaee.home}/bin/wsimport -d ./build http://${javaee.server.name}:${javaee.server.port}/xwss-bank-service/BankAccountService?WSDL"/>
</code>

<h2>Compile Client</h2>
The client is compiled like so:
<p><code>
javac -cp ./build:${javaee.home}/lib/javaee.jar -d ./build client/Client.java 
</code>

<h2>Run the Client</H2>
You can run the client like this:
<p>
<code>
cd ./build
${javaee.home}/bin/appclient.bat client.Client
</code>
<p>
The client will securely send the amount
you would like to deposit into your bank account to the Webservice.
</code>


<h2>Building, Deploying, and Running the Application in NetBeans IDE</h2>
<p>
Follow these instructions to build, deploy, and run
this sample application using NetBeans IDE.
</p>
<ol>
  <li> Refer to  <a href="../../../docs/UserREADME.html"> common build instructions.</a>
       for setting up NetBeans IDE and the application server with which the IDE will use.</li>
  <li> Make sure that you have defined the appropriate values in build.properties based on above
       common build instructions which is a pre-requisite for this sample.
  <li> In NetBeans IDE, select File->OpenProject and select 
<code><i>samples_install_dir</i>/javaee5/webservices/xwss-bank-client</code> as the project.</li>
  <li> Right click on <code>xwss-bank-client</code> and select <code>Run Project</code> which will build, deploy and run the project. Sample output is given below. </li>
</ol>
