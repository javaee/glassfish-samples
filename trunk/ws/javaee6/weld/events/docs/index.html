<h1>CDI Interceptors Sample Application</h1>

<p>CDI Interceptors intercept on invocations and lifecycle events on 
an associated target class.  Basically, interceptor is a class whose 
methods are invoked when business methods on the target class are 
invoked and/or lifecycle events such as methods that create/destroy 
the bean occur. Interceptors are typically used to implement 
cross-cutting concerns like logging, auditing, and profiling.
<p>
This demo is intended to illustrate how interceptors can be added to a CDI bean that mimics a shopping cart.
The demo uses a <code>ShoppingServlet</code> to add items to the cart. The cart itself
is injected as a CDI bean and has a class-level interceptor which ensures that
the interceptor is applied to all methods of the bean. The interceptor (<code>LoggingInterceptorSimple</code>) is enabled
in WEB-INF/beans.xml and prints the method name being invoked. <p>An alternative 
interceptor implementation (commented out in beans.xml) is also available and
may be enabled instead of or in addition to the existing interceptor.
</p>

<p>The code snippet below indicates how LoggingInterceptor is defined.
The <code>@AroundInvoke</code> (can be only one per interceptor) on a method 
in the interceptor class ensures that this method is invoked around the 
business method interception. 
</p>

<p><code>
@LoggingInterceptor<br>
@Interceptor<br>
public class LoggingInterceptorSimple {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@AroundInvoke<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public Object log(InvocationContext context) throws Exception {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System.out.println("LOG: " + context.getMethod());<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return context.proceed();<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
}<br>
</code>

<h2>Building, Deploying, and Running the Application</h2>

<p>Perform the following steps to build, deploy, and run the
application:<br>
<br>
</p>

<ol>

  <li> Set up your build environment and configure the application
server with which the build system has to work by following the <a href="../../../../docs/UserREADME.html">
common build instructions.</a></li>
  <li><code><i>app_dir</i></code> is the sample application base
directory:<code><i>samples_install_dir</i>/javaee6/weld/interceptors/</code>.</li>
  <li><code></code><code></code>Change directory to <code><i>app_dir.<br>
    </i></code></li>
  <li>Build, deploy, and run the sample application using the <code>all</code>
target.<code></code></li>
  <p><code><span style="font-style: italic;">app_dir&gt; </span>ant
all</code><br>
  </p>
  <p>You can replace the <code>ant all</code> command with the
following set of
commands:<br>
  </p>
  <p><code><span style="font-style: italic;">app_dir&gt; </span>ant
default</code> compiles and packages the application </p>
  <p><code><span style="font-style: italic;">app_dir&gt; </span>ant
deploy</code> deploys it to application server </p>
  <p><code><span style="font-style: italic;">app_dir&gt;&nbsp;</span></code>
To run the sample, deploy the application using the instructions below
and visit the URL <a href="http://localhost:8080/interceptors">http://localhost:8080/interceptors</a> </p>
  <li>Use the target clean to undeploy the sample application and to
remove the temporary directories such as build and dist.
    <p><code><span style="font-style: italic;">app_dir&gt; </span>ant
clean</code><br>
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>


<h2>Building, Deploying, and Running the Application in NetBeans IDE</h2>

<p>Perform the following steps to build, deploy, and run the
application using NetBeans IDE:</p>

<ol>

  <li> Refer to the <a href="../../../docs/UserREADME.html"> common
build instructions</a> for setting up NetBeans IDE and Sun GlassFish
Enterprise Server.</li>
  <li> In the NetBeans IDE, choose File &#8594; Open Project (Ctrl-Shift-O),
navigate to the <code><i>samples_install_dir</i>/javaee6/weld/</code>
directory, select <code>interceptors</code>, and click Open Project.</li>
  <li> In the Projects tab, right click <code>interceptors</code> and
select Run to build, deploy, and run the project.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

If you have problems when running the application, refer the <a href="../../../../docs/UserTroubleShooting.html">
troubleshooting document</a>.
