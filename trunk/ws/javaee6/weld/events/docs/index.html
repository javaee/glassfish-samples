<h1>CDI Events Sample Application</h1>

<p>Contexts & Dependency Injection (JSR 299) defines a standards-based 
type-safe Dependency Injection mechanism in the Java EE 6 platform. The 
type-safety comes from the fact that no String-based identifiers are 
used to identify the dependencies and instead all the information is 
specified using the Java object model. The loose coupling is possible 
because the bean requesting injection need not be aware of the 
lifecycle, concrete implementation, threading model and similar details 
of the injected bean. The CDI runtime automatically figures out the 
right bean in the right scope and context and then injects it correctly 
for the requestor.
<p>
CDI Events take loose coupling to the next level by following the Observer 
pattern. Event producers raise events that are consumed by observers. 
The event object carries state from producer to consumer. The producer
can fire the events and observer can specify qualifiers to narrow the set of
events received.
<p>
This demo is intended to illustrate how events can be produced by stateless
EJB and consumed by a singleton EJB. As EJBs in Java EE 6 are also POJOs they
have all the characteristics of a CDI bean as well. 
The demo uses a <code>PrintServlet</code> to invoke a print page stateless EJB. The
bean fires events based upon the number of pages. These events are then consumed
by <code>PrintObserver</code> bean and a statement is printed out.
</p>

<p>The code snippet below indicates how <code>PrintProducer</code> is firing events.
</p>

<p><code>
@Inject Event<PrintEvent> printEvent;<br>
@Inject @BindIt Event<PrintEvent> printAndBindEvent;<br>
<br>
public void print(int pages) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PrintEvent event = new PrintEvent(pages);<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (pages < 10)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;printEvent.fire(event);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;else<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;printAndBindEvent.fire(event);<br>
}<br>
</code>
</p>
And how <code>PrintObserver</code> is consuming events.
<p>
<code>
public void onPrintAndBind(@Observes @BindIt PrintEvent event) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System.out.println("Printing and binding " + event.getPages() + " pages");<br>
}<br>
<br>
public void onPrint(@Observes @Default PrintEvent event) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System.out.println("Printing " + event.getPages() + " pages");<br>
}<br>
</code>

<h2>Building, Deploying, and Running the Application</h2>

<p>Perform the following steps to build, deploy, and run the
application:<br>
<br>
</p>

<ol>

  <li> Set up your build environment and configure the application
server with which the build system has to work by following the <a href="../../../../docs/UserREADME.html">
common build instructions.</a></li>
  <li><code><i>app_dir</i></code> is the sample application base
directory:<code><i>samples_install_dir</i>/javaee6/weld/events/</code>.</li>
  <li><code></code><code></code>Change directory to <code><i>app_dir.<br>
    </i></code></li>
  <li>Build, deploy, and run the sample application using the <code>all</code>
target.<code></code></li>
  <p><code><span style="font-style: italic;">app_dir&gt; </span>ant
all</code><br>
  </p>
  <p>You can replace the <code>ant all</code> command with the
following set of
commands:<br>
  </p>
  <p><code><span style="font-style: italic;">app_dir&gt; </span>ant
default</code> compiles and packages the application </p>
  <p><code><span style="font-style: italic;">app_dir&gt; </span>ant
deploy</code> deploys it to application server </p>
  <p><code><span style="font-style: italic;">app_dir&gt;&nbsp;</span></code>
To run the sample, deploy the application using the instructions below
and visit the URL <a href="http://localhost:8080/events">http://localhost:8080/events</a> </p>
  <li>Use the target clean to undeploy the sample application and to
remove the temporary directories such as build and dist.
    <p><code><span style="font-style: italic;">app_dir&gt; </span>ant
clean</code><br>
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>


<h2>Building, Deploying, and Running the Application in NetBeans IDE</h2>

<p>Perform the following steps to build, deploy, and run the
application using NetBeans IDE:</p>

<ol>

  <li> Refer to the <a href="../../../docs/UserREADME.html"> common
build instructions</a> for setting up NetBeans IDE and Sun GlassFish
Enterprise Server.</li>
  <li> In the NetBeans IDE, choose File &#8594; Open Project (Ctrl-Shift-O),
navigate to the <code><i>samples_install_dir</i>/javaee6/weld/</code>
directory, select <code>events</code>, and click Open Project.</li>
  <li> In the Projects tab, right click <code>events</code> and
select Run to build, deploy, and run the project.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

If you have problems when running the application, refer the <a href="../../../../docs/UserTroubleShooting.html">
troubleshooting document</a>.
