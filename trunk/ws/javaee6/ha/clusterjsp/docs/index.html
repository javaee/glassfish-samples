<h1>!!!!! TO BE MODIFIED FOR 3.1 The Cluster JSP Sample Application!!!!</h1>

<p>
The cluster JSP sample application demonstrates how a request to a JSP is shared
or load balanced between all server instances in a cluster, with the HttpSession
or "shopping cart" information surviving an abnormal condition in any server
in a cluster.&nbsp; Simulated outages will demonstrate both failover and
high availability.&nbsp; The Load Balancer will distribute requests to
all instances in the cluster. It has the ability to forward a request to
a healthy instance if it detects that the target instance is unavailable.

<h2>Building, Deploying, and Running the Application</h2>

<p>
The general instructions for building, deploying, and running sample applications are provided in
<a href="../../../../../docs/common-procedures.html">Building, Deploying, and Running Sample Applications</a>.
In reading this document, use the following application-specific variables for this application:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><code><i>install_dir</i></code> is the directory where Application Server is installed.
  <li><code><i>app_dir</i></code> is the application base directory:
    <code><i>install_dir</i>/samples/ee-samples/highavailability/apps/clusterjsp</code>.
  <li><i>appname</i> is the application name: clusterjsp.
  <li>The prebuilt EAR file is <code>clusterjsp.ear</code>.
</ul>

<p>
Follow this general procedure:
<ol>
    <li>Follow the instructions in <a href="../../../../ee-setup.html">Setting Up Enterprise Edition Sample Applications</a>
    to configure the load balancer and HADB for an Application Server cluster.
    <li><a href="../../../../../docs/common-procedures.html#build">Build the Application</a>.
      The build file, <code>build.xml</code>, is in the <code><i>app_dir</i></code> directory.
    <li><a href="../../../../../docs/common-procedures.html#deploy">Deploy the Application</a>
      The EAR file is
      <code><i>install_dir</i>/samples/ee-samples/highavailability/apps/clusterjsp/clusterjsp.ear</code>.
<br>
      <b>Note</b>: The first time you run <code>asant deploy</code>, it will prompt you for
       your Application Server host name, administration port, administration user and password
       and cluster name. The script will save these values in a properties file, and running it
       subsequently will get this information from the file.
    <li>Run the application, as described below.
</ol>


<h2>Running the Sample Application</h2>

<p>
After you have built and deployed the application, run it by entering the
following URL in your web browser:
<pre>
http://<i>ws-host</i>:<i>ws-port</i>/clusterJSP
</pre>

<p>
Where <i>ws-host</i> is the hostname of web server with the load balancer plugin
and <i>ws-port</i> is the port one which the web server is running.
Then, follow these instructions to use the application to demonstrate clustering:


<p>The images from running the application:
<p><img SRC="images/cluster-sample.jpg" height=819 width=705>

<p>Now, stop the instance that served the request.  For instructions no how to stop an instance,
see <a href="../../../../ee-setup.html#stop-instance">Stopping an Application Server Instance</a>.
After the instance is shut down completely, add another sesion attribute.
You will see that the session attributes stored earlier will also be retreived and displayed.
