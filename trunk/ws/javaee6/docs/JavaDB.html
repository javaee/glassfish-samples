<h1>Using Java DB with Sample applications</h1>
<p>
The Java EE SDK includes the Java DB database server.
This document describes how to start and stop the Java DB database
server, create and delete databases using SQL scripts,
create and delete JDBC connection pools, create and delete JDBC
resources. </p>
<p>
Properties for the database are defined in the file <a
 href="../../bp-project/app-server.properties">bp-project/app-server.properties</a>.
The <code>db.home</code> property specifies where Java DB creates new
databases.
Make sure that this property specifies a directory for which you have
write
permission.</p>
<p>
Generally, each sample application has a <code>setup</code>
sub-directory
used to define the JDBC resources (and any other resources) needed for
the project. The <a href="./javadb-setup/build.xml">build.xml</a> file
in this directory
defines Ant targets for manipulating the database. Usually, you must
create and populate the database and configure corresponding JDBC
resources before running the
application. </p>
