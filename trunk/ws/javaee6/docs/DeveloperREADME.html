<h1>Sample Applications Development Process<br>
</h1>
The process for checking out workspace, developing,
testing, documenting, and checking in the sample application into
glassfish-samples project is as follows: <br>
<br>
<ol>
  <li>Get developer access to <a
 href="https://glassfish-samples.dev.java.net/">glassfish-samples</a>
project
by sending email to <a href="mailto:dev@glassfish-samples.dev.java.net">dev@glassfish-samples.dev.java.net</a>
with your GlassFish user id. Once you are granted the developer access,
you will be able to check out from and check in to the samples
workspace.</li>
  <li>Check out the glassfish-samples project of java.net with a Subversion client using the following command. Note: replace the last username with your own username.<br>
    <code>svn checkout https://glassfish-samples.dev.java.net/svn/glassfish-samples/trunk glassfish-samples --username username</code></li>
  <li>There are separate directories for each version of Java EE. The
samples for Java EE 6 are under the <code>javaee6</code> directory
and the samples for Java EE 5 are under the <code>javaee5</code>
directory.<br>
  </li>
  <li>All the samples follow blueprints <a
 href="http://java.sun.com/blueprints/code/projectconventions.html">project
conventions</a> for directory structure and <a
 href="http://java.sun.com/blueprints/code/namingconventions.html">naming</a>.<br>
  </li>
  <li>The sample applications use the blue prints build infrastructure
called <code>bp-project</code>, which is at the top level of samples
directory so that it can be shared by many sample applications. The
bp-project is part of blueprints java.net project on <a
 href="https://conventions.dev.java.net/">conventions</a>.<br>
  </li>
  <li>It is important that each sample application is provided with
appropriate documentation and test code. </li>
  <li>Refer to the existing representative sample <code></code><code>hello-stateless-ejb</code>&nbsp;
under the <code>javaee6</code> directory to understand the directory
structure, build scripts, test code, documentation.<br>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li><code>hello-stateless-ejb</code> shows how to build an ejb
module, provide test
code using a java client<br>
    </li>
    <li>For better user experience, the number of ant targets to be
executed by
the developer need to be kept to a minimum. Basically, the default ant
target should be able to build, deploy and run the sample. All of the
representative samples do this by using the ant target 'all'.</li>
    <li>To understand how the entire build infrastructure works and
what are various
targets, refer to <a href="../../bp-project/docs/DeveloperREADME.html">build
infrastructure
documentation</a>. <br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>For guidelines
on documenting the sample, refer to the representative
sample <code>hello-stateless-ejb</code>, which is documented using the
    <a
 href="http://wiki.glassfish.java.net/attach/JavaEE6Samples/index.html">sample
application
documentation
template</a>.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Each sample application needs one or more test cases so that the
sample applications go through some regular testing like glassfish to
notice any regressions and for the purposes of promoting the samples
bundle. Refer to the test directory of representative sample <code>hello-stateless-ejb</code>
for information.<br>
    <br>
Refer to documentation on <a href="../../javaee5/docs/UnitTesting.html">developing
unit
tests</a> for detailed information. </li>
  <li>For setup of database and usage of JDBC resources, refer to <a
 href="../../javaee5/docs/JavaDB.html">Using Java DB with Sample
applications.</a></li>
  <li>Make sure that the sample works with Netbeans IDE.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Once the sample application development, testing and
documentation is complete, get it reviewed by a domain expert or a
colleague before checking it in.<br>
  </li>
