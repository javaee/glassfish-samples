Note to sample developers.
The actual source code for this sample is maintained in subversion 
under the repository
 <https://mojarra.dev.java.net/svn/mojarra/branches/scrumtoys-glassfishv3-20090506>.

The source code checked in here under CVS is arrived at by checking
out the above repo and running 

ant -f blueprints-deploy-sample.xml -Dblueprint.sample=<sample_dir>

where <sample_dir> is the local workarea to which the sample should be copied,
blueprints fashion.
