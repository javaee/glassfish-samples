<h1>The Servlet 3.0 ServletContainerInitializer Sample Application</h1>
This sample application demonstrates how the ServletContainerInitializer
feature can be used by libraries to register interest in certain types of
applications and take whatever action as the library sees fit.<br>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This sample application has a (dummy) library with a class, <tt>org.glassfish.servlet.container_initializer_lib.Initializer</tt>, that implements <tt>javax.servlet.ServletContainerInitializer</tt>. This class declares interest in any
    web application that has a class that uses the <tt>@javax.servlet.annotation.WebServlet</tt> annotation. This
    class registers such interest by using the <tt>@javax.servlet.annotation.HandlesTypes</tt> annotation. The action performed by this (dummy) library is to set an attibute <tt>SHAREDLIB-1</tt> in the <tt>ServletContext</tt> whenever an application, in which
    at least one class uses <tt>@WebServlet</tt> annotation, is getting deployed.</p>
<p>The main web application in this sample has a class that uses <tt>@WebServlet</tt> annotation and this class checks if the attribute <tt>SHAREDLIB-1</tt> is indeed set
    in the <tt>ServletContext</tt> for this application.</p>
<p>When started, this sample, stops GlassFish server (if it is already running), creates
    the (dummy) library and places this library JAR file in the <tt>$GLASSFISH_HOME/lib</tt> directory before restarting GlassFish server. During server start, the web container
    scans the libraries and registers the <tt>ServletContainerInitializer</tt> implementations
    and their respective interest. When the sample application (which uses <tt>@WebServlet</tt>)
    is deployed, the web container recognizes that the <tt>ServletContainerInitializer</tt> implementation in the (dummy) library will be interested in this application. Hence the web
    container will call the <tt>onStartUp</tt> method which will set <tt>SHAREDLIB-1</tt> attribute in the <tt>ServletContext</tt> of the application which is read and printed by
    the sample application on the browser.</p>
<h2>Building, Deploying, and Running the Application</h2>
<p> Perform the following steps to build, deploy, and run the
    application:<br>
  </p>
<ol>
    <li> Set up your build environment and configure the application
    server with which the build system has to work by following the <a
 href="../../../../docs/UserREADME.html"> common build instructions.</a></li>
    <li><code><i>app_dir</i></code> is the sample application base
    directory: <code><i>samples_install_dir</i>/javaee7/servlet/servlet-container-initializer</code>.</li>
    <li><code></code><code></code>Change directory to <code><i>app_dir.<br>
    </i></code></li>
    <li>Build the sample application using the <code>mvn</code> target:</li>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can use the command below to compile initializer library and build the main web application war file:<br>
  </p>
    <p><code><span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; app_dir&gt; </span>mvn install </code><br>
  </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Note</b>: The initializer library is under <code>app_dir/servlet-container-initializer-lib/target/</code> The main web application war file is under <code>app_dir/servlet-container-initializer-war/target/</code><br>
  </p>
    <li>Copy <code>servlet-container-initializer-lib.jar</code> to <code>$GLASSFISH_HOME/lib</code>.</li>
    <li>Deploy the application:</li>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can go to: <code>app_dir/servlet-container-initializer-war/target</code> to find the war file. Deploy the war file by using the command below:</p>
    <p><code><span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;servlet-container-initializer-war/&gt; </span>asadmin deploy ./target/servlet-container-initializer-war.war</code><br>
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Note</b>: You have to restart the server before running the application<br>
  </p>
    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note</span>: You can run the
    test in the following way:
      <ul>
        <li>Use the browser to access
        http:&lt;javaee.server.name&gt;:&lt;javaee.server.port&gt;/servlet-container-initializer-war <br>
        The following output is expected in the browser: <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>ServletContainerInitializer says : Attribute successfully set by SharedLibrary class which has expressed interest in @WebServlet</tt> </li>
        
      </ul>
  </li>
    <li>Use the glassfish command line to undeploy the application.
      <p><code><span style="font-style: italic;">app_dir&gt; </span>
      asadmin undeploy &lt;app_name&gt;</code></p>
  </li>
    <li>Use the target <code>clean</code> to remove the temporary directories
    like /target.
      <p><code><span style="font-style: italic;">app_dir&gt; </span>mvn
      clean</code> </p>
  </li>
  </ol>
<h2>Building, Deploying, and Running the Application in NetBeans IDE</h2>
<p>Perform the following steps to build, deploy, and run the application using NetBeans IDE:</p>
<ol>
    <li> Refer to the <a href="../../../../docs/UserREADME.html"> common build instructions</a> for setting up NetBeans IDE and Java EE 7 SDK.</li>
    <li> In the NetBeans IDE, choose File &#8594; Open Project (Ctrl-Shift-O), navigate to the <code><i>samples_install_dir</i>/javaee7/servlet/</code> directory, select <code>servlet-container-initializer-war</code>, select Open Required Projects, and click Open Project.</li>
    <li> In the Projects tab, right click <code>servlet-container-initializer-war</code> and select Run to build, deploy, and run the project.</li>
    <p><b>Note</b>: You may have to copy the servlet-container-initializer-lib.jar to $GLASSFISH_HOME/lib and restart the server before running the application</p>
  </ol>
<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>If you have problems when running the application, refer the <a
 href="../../../../docs/UserTroubleShooting.html"> troubleshooting document</a>. </p>
