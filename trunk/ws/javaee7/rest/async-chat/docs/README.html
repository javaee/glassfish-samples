        <h1>JAX-RS Asynchronous Chat Sample</h1>
        <p>Sample using JAX-RS asynchronous features to implement simple producer/consumer chat.</p>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This sample shows usage of javax.ws.rs.container.AsyncResponse. Deployed resource ChatResource contains two methods
            which both works in asynchronous mode. They contain @AsyncResponse annotated asyncResponse that causes to
            run these methods in the suspended mode. In this mode the response is not returned from the resource method
            as a return value but must be resumed by calling AsyncResponse.resume() method. Before the response is resumed
            the execution thread is returned back to container.
        </p>
        <p>
            Resource method receiving the message (ChatResource.getMesssage()) stores the async response into a blocking
            queue. After the message is send to server (ChatResource.posMesssage()) the async response of request waiting
            for message is taken from the queue and it is resumed with the message. Instead of keeping messages in the queue
            the responses waiting for these messages are kept and messages are directly delivered to them when they are
            available.
        </p>
        <p>Front page shows the text input field for message. Enter the message and click POST MESSAGE. The background
        asynchronous POST request will be invoked to server where it will be blocked on the blocking queue until any
        message is requested. Then click
        GET MESSAGE which also invokes background asynchronous GET request to the server. This will be suspended and afterwards
        resumed with the message from the POST request that is still waiting blocked on the blocking queue. Message
        will be returned to the browser and message is displayed in the box below the GET MESSAGE button. When buttons
        are clicked in the opposite order the GET request will be suspended waiting to be resumed by incoming POST request.
        </p>
        <p>The screen also contains the field with the status of an asynchronous queue kept in the ChatResource. This
            field is automatically refreshed in short intervals by calling the GET on /chat/queue from ChatResource.
        </p>
        <p>
        Only one GET and one POST request can be sent to the server (then buttons are disabled). In order to submit more
        GET and POST requests more browser windows needs to be opened. The screen also contains log of asynchronous requests
        done by browser.</p>


        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>@AsyncResponse</li>
            <li>@Path, @Singleton</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Building, Deploying, and Running the Application</h2>
        <!-- Modify this section as needed -->
        <p>Perform the following steps to build, deploy, and run the application:</p>
        <ol>
            <li> Set up your build environment and configure the application server with which the build system has to work by following the <a href="../../../docs/UserREADME.html">common build instructions.</a></li>
            <li><code><i>samples_install_dir</i></code> is the sample application base directory. Go to: <code><i>samples_install_dir</i>/javaee7/rest/async-chat</code>.</li>
            <li>Build, deploy, and run the sample application using the <code>run</code> outcome.
                <p><code>mvn clean verify cargo:run</code></p>
            </li>
            <li>Front page of this sample is at <a href="http://localhost:8080/async-chat">http://localhost:8080/async-chat</a> (port number might vary)</li>
            <li>Use the <code>clean</code> outcome to undeploy the sample application and to remove the temporary directories such as <code>build</code> and <code>dist</code>.
                <p><code>mvn clean</code></p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
        <p>If you have problems when running the application, refer to the <a href="../../../docs/UserTroubleShooting.html">troubleshooting document</a>.</p>
