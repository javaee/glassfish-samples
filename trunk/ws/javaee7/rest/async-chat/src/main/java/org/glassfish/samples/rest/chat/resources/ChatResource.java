/**
 * Resource that handles one way asynchronous chatting based on consumes produces mechanism.
 * <p/>
 * Message is sent (produces) using POST http method handled by {@link #postMessage(javax.ws.rs.container.AsyncResponse, String)}
 * and this message is received (consumed) by GET http method handled by {@link #getMessage(javax.ws.rs.container.AsyncResponse,
 * String)}.
 * <p/>
 * This implementation of produces consumes mechanism does not keep a queue of messages but a queue of responses waiting for
 * messages. Message is always delivered directly from thread handling posting of message to the thread handling receiving of
 * message. Request processing must be therefore synchronized by blocking threads. In order to save server resources the original
 * threads are returned to the container.
