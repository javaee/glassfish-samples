<h1>The JavaServer Faces/Java Persistence Sample Application</h1>

<p>
    This sample demonstrates the use of Java Persistence APIs based on the new
    Java Persistence specification along with JavaServer Faces that
    creates a simple authentication scheme using JavaServer Faces
    PhaseListeners and a simple Entity bean representing a user.
</p>

<p>If you are familiar with EJB 2.1 persistence, you will notice many changes in this example based on the new Java Persistence specification.
    Although this application provides the same functionality as a corresponding
    EJB 2.1 implementation, it is much simpler:
    <ul>
        <li>There are no complex and arcane deployment descriptors.
            All metadata information is specified by annotations, and you do not
            have to implement any
            EJBLocalObject or EJBObject interfaces.
        <li>You can rely a great deal on defaults,
            so you code for the exceptional cases. This significantly reduces
            turnaround time
            for implementations.
        <li>Most importantly, you can switch your
            persistence implementation to any vendor that supports the Java
            Persistence specification.
    </ul>
</p>

<p>Additionally, JavaServer Faces can easily use JPA within its
    managed bean facility through resource injection, making it easier
  to bridge between web and EJB applications.</p>

<h2>Application Structure</h2>

<p>
    The application is built and deployed as a WAR file.

<h3>Web Module</h3>

<p>
    The web module consists of:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Several JSP pages which represent the view layer of the
            application
        </li>
        <li>
            A simple Entity bean which represents a user
        </li>
        <li>
            A JSF managed bean which is the mediator between
            the JSF application and the Entity bean
        </li>
        <li>
            A JSF PhaseListener which determines whether or not
            a request has access to a secure resource
        </li>
    </ul>
    The starting point of the application is the main<code>index.html</code>
    page. Follow these steps to see the application in action:
    <ol>
        <li>
            Click the <code>JavaServer Faces Welcome Page</code> link.
            Because the user hasn't been authenticated, the PhaseListener
            will direct the user to the login page.
        </li>
        <li>
            Make an attempt to log in. The JSF managed bean,
            <code>UserManager</code> will use JPA to attempt to locate
            the appropriate Enity based of the provided user name.
            Because the example starts from scratch each time it is deployed,
            an error message states that the user doesn't exist.
        </li>
        <li>
            Click the <code>Create New Account</code> link.
            Fill out the form. If any fields are left empty,
            or the passwords do not match, error messages are
            provided. Click the <code>Create</code> button.
            If everything is in order, the user is directed
            back to the login page.
        </li>
        <li>
            Attempt to log in again, using the user name previously specified, and a bad password. This time, we locate the appropriate
            Entity, but because the password isn't correct, an error message
            is displayed.
        </li>
        <li>
            Now log in again, with the correct user name and password. This
            will take you to the resource originally referenced by the
            <code>JavaServer Faces Welcome Page</code> link. The welcome
            page should greet the user with their first and last name,
            and the date they registered.
        </li>
    </ol>
</p>

<h2>Building, Deploying, and Running the Application</h2>

<p>Follow these steps to build, deploy, and run the application.</p>

<ol>
    <li> Set up your build environment and Configure the application
        server with which the build system has to work by following the <a
          href="../../../docs/UserREADME.html">
        common build instructions.</a></li>

    <li>
        <p>Make sure the JavaDB database is started. If not, refer to
            <a href="../../../docs/UserREADME.html"> common build
                instructions.</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        Use the target <code>all</code> to build,deploy and run the project.
    </li>
    <li>
        Use the target <code>clean</code> to remove the temporary directories 
        like build and dist       
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>Building, Deploying, and Running the Application in NetBeans IDE</h2>
<p>
Follow these instructions to build, deploy, and run
this sample application using NetBeans IDE.
</p>
<ol>
  <li> Refer to  <a href="../../../docs/UserREADME.html"> common build instructions.</a>
       for setting up NetBeans IDE and the application server with which the IDE will use.</li>
  <li> In NetBeans IDE, select File->OpenProject and select 
<code><i>samples_install_dir</i>/javaee5/enterprise/jsf-jpa-war</code> as the project.</li>
  <li> Right click on <code>jsf-jpa-war</code> and select <code>Run Project</code> which will build, deploy and run the project. If configured properly, the IDE will open the browser with appropriate url. Sample output is given below. </li>
  <b>NetBeans IDE output</b>
  <pre>
  All operations completed successfully
  run-deploy:
  Browsing: http://localhost:8080/jsf-jpa-war/
  run-display-browser:
  run:
  BUILD SUCCESSFUL (total time: 5 seconds)
  </pre>
  <b>Browser output</b>
  <pre>
  http://localhost:8080/jsf-jpa-war/

  Java Server Faces Welcome Page
  </pre>
</ol>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
