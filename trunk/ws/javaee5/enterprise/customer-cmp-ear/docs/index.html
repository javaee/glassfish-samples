<h1>The Java Persistence Sample Application</h1>
<p>This sample demonstrates the use of Java Persistence APIs based on
the new Java Persistence specification.
It interacts with a relational database to store and display
information about customer subscriptions to periodicals.
</p>
<p>If you are familiar with EJB 2.1 persistence, you will notice a lot
of changes in this example based on the new Java Persistence
specification. Although this application provides the same
functionality as a corresponding EJB 2.1 implementation, it is much
simpler: </p>
<ul>
  <li>There are no complex and arcane deployment descriptors. All
metadata information is specified by annotations and you do not have to
implement any EJBLocalObject or EJBObject interfaces. </li>
  <li>You can rely a great deal on defaults, so you code for the
exceptional cases. This significantly reduces turnaround time for
implementations. </li>
  <li>Most importantly, you can switch your persistence implementation
to any vendor that supports the Java Persistence specification. </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h2>Application Structure</h2>
<p>
The application is built and deployed as an EAR file. It consists of
two modules: the web module and
the EJB module.
</p>
<h3>Web Module</h3>
<p>
The web module consists of JSP files that contain the presentation
logic for the sample.
The starting point of the application is the main<code>index.html</code>
page,
from which you can navigate to different
pages to perform tasks such as creating a customer, searching for a
customer, searching for an address,
creating more subscriptions, and editing a customer profile. Each of
these pages has
a [HOME] link, that returns you to the main page.
</p>
<h3>EJB Module</h3>
<p>
The EJB module consists of a stateless session bean, the persistence
unit and some supporting classes.
The JSP files look up the CustomerSession stateless session bean and,
based on the client inputs,
invoke its business methods.
</p>
<p>The CustomerSession stateless session bean uses resource injection
to get access to an EntityManager.
It uses the entity manager for all persistence related operations, such
as inserts, updates and lookups.
The entity classes are Address, Customer and Subscription. These are
plain old Java objects (POJOs) with
metadata annotations that describe their database mappings,
associations with other entities, and fetch
strategy.
</p>
<p>The persistence classes are archived in <code>customer-cmp-ejb.jar</code>
along with a
<code>persistence.xml</code>, that defines
the EntityManager provider class and the database connection
information for the persistence unit.
</p>
<h2>Application archive</h2>
<p>
The web-module and ejb-module are archived in <code>customer-cmp-ear.ear</code>.
</p>
<h2>Building, Deploying, and Running the Application</h2>
<p>Follow these steps to build, deploy, and run the application.</p>
<ol>
  <li> Set up your build environment and Configure the application
server with which the build system has to work by following the <a
 href="../../../docs/UserREADME.html"> common build instructions.</a></li>
  <li><code><i>app_dir</i></code> is the sample application base
directory: <code><i>install_dir</i>/samples/ws/javaee5/enterprise/customer-cmp-ear</code></li>
  <li>Change directory to <code><i>app_dir.</i></code></li>
  <li>
    <p>Make sure the JavaDB database is started. If not, refer to <a
 href="../../../docs/UserREADME.html"> common build instructions.</a> </p>
  </li>
  <li>Create database
    <p>Change directory to <code><i>app_dir/setup </i></code></p>
    <p><code><i>app_dir/setup&gt; </i>ant create-db </code></p>
  </li>
  <li>Set up JDBC resources, Compile, Deploy and Run the sample
application using the target all:
    <p>Change directory to <code><i>app_dir </i></code></p>
    <p><code><i>app_dir&gt; </i> ant all</code> </p>
  </li>
  <li>It is possible to do the above separately by issuing separate
commands: <br>
    <code><i>app_dir&gt; </i>ant setup</code> creates jdbc-resources <br>
    <code><i>app_dir&gt; </i>ant default</code> compiles and packages
the application <br>
    <code><i>app_dir&gt; </i>ant deploy</code> deploys it to
application server <br>
    <code><i>app_dir&gt; </i>ant run</code> runs the sample from a
browser using the URL <code>http://[<i>hostname</i>]:8080/customer-cmp-war/index.html</code>
  </li>
  <li>Remove the database resources:
    <p><i>app_dir&gt; </i><code>ant unsetup </code></p>
  </li>
  <li>Use the target clean to remove the temporary directories like
build and dist
    <p><code><i>app_dir&gt; </i>ant clean</code> </p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Building, Deploying, and Running the Application in NetBeans IDE</h2>
<p>
Follow these instructions to build, deploy, and run
this sample application using NetBeans IDE.
</p>
<ol>
  <li> Refer to  <a href="../../../docs/UserREADME.html"> common build instructions.</a>
       for setting up NetBeans IDE and the application server with which the IDE will use.</li>
  <li> In NetBeans IDE, select File->OpenProject and select 
<code><i>samples_install_dir</i>/javaee5/enterprise/customer-cmp-ear</code> as the project.</li>
  <li> Right click on <code>customer-cmp-ear</code> and select <code>Run Project</code> which will build, deploy and run the project. If configured properly, the IDE will open the browser with the url <code>http://localhost:8080/customer-cmp-war</code>. Sample output is given below. </li>
  <b>NetBeans IDE output</b>
  <pre>
  post-init:
  init-check:
  init:
  run-ac:
  BUILD SUCCESSFUL (total time: 22 seconds)
  </pre>
  <b>Browser output</b>
  <pre>
  http://localhost:8080/customer-cmp-war/

  Simple CMP Example -- Customer

  Create New Customer
  Search For Customer
  Create New Subscription
  Search For Subscription
  Search For Address 
  </pre>
</ol>
<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>If you have problems when running the application, refer to <a
 href="../../../docs/UserTroubleShooting.html"> troubleshooting document</a>.
