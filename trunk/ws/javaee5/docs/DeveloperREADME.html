<h1>Sample Applications Development Process.<br>
</h1>
Following is the process for checking out workspace, developing,
testing, documenting and checking in the sample application into
glassfish-samples project. <br>
<br>
<ol>
  <li>Get developer access to <a
 href="https://glassfish-samples.dev.java.net/">glassfish-samples</a>
project
by sending email to <a href="mailto:msreddy@dev.java.net">msreddy@dev.java.net</a>
with your glassfish user id. Once you are granted the developer access,
you will be able to check out from and check in to the samples
workspace.</li>
  <li>Check out the glassfish-samples project of java.net.<br>
    <code>cvs -d
:pserver:&lt;glassfish-userid&gt;@cvs.dev.java.net:/cvs co
glassfish-samples</code><br>
  </li>
  <li>All the samples follow blueprints <a
 href="http://java.sun.com/blueprints/code/projectconventions.html">project
conventions</a> for directory structure and <a
 href="http://java.sun.com/blueprints/code/namingconventions.html">naming</a>.<br>
  </li>
  <li>The sample applications use blue prints build infrastructure
called <code>bp-project</code> which is at the top level of samples
directory so that it can be shared by many sample applications. The
bp-project is part of blueprints java.net project on <a
 href="https://conventions.dev.java.net/">conventions</a>.<br>
  </li>
  <li>It is important that each sample application is provided with
appropriate documentation and test code. </li>
  <li>Refer to the existing representative samples <code>duke-stateful-ear</code>
and <code>hello-stateless-ejb</code>&nbsp; to understand the directory
structure, build scripts, test code, documentation.<br>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li><code>duke-stateful.ear</code> shows how to build an ear
consisting of ejb and
application client, and how to run application client</li>
    <li><code>hello-stateless-ejb</code> shows how to build an ejb
module, provide test
code using a java client<br>
    </li>
    <li>For better user experience the number of ant targets to be
executed by
the developer need to be kept to a minimum. Basically, the default ant
target should be able to build, deploy and run the sample. All of the
representative samples do this by using the ant target 'all'.</li>
    <li>To understand how the entire build infrastructure works and
what are various
targets, pl. refer to <a
 href="../../bp-project/docs/DeveloperREADME.html">build
infrastructure
documentation</a>. <br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>For guidelines
on documenting the sample, refer to the representative
sample <code>hello-stateless-ejb</code> which is documented using the <a
 href="./sample_doc_template.html">sample application documentation
template</a>.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Each sample application needs one or more test cases so that the
sample applications go thru some regular testing like glassfish to
notice any regressions and for the purposes of promoting the samples
bundle. Refer to the test directory of representative sample <code>hello-stateless-ejb</code>
for information.<br>
    <br>
The ant target which need to be executed for testing purpose is the
'runtest'.</li>
  <li>For setup of database and usage of jdbc resources, refer to <a
 href="./DerbyDB.html">Using Derby database with Sample applications.</a><br>
  </li>
  <li>Once the sample application development, testing and
documentation is complete, get it reviewed by a domain expert or a
colleague before checking it in.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>A representative
sample to illustrate the setup and use of jms resource is under
construction.</li>
