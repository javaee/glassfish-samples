<h1>A Secure X.509 Based WebService Sample Application</h1>
This sample demonstrates how to:
<ul>
<li>Write a Secure Webservice
<li>Compile and deploy the Webservice
</ul>
<h2> Configuration</h2>
The build script is designed to be easily moved anywhere else and modified.  To keep things as simple as possible it is <i>not</i> dependent on the
build framework in the Samples hierarchy.
<p>You do, however, have to setup some variables for Ant.  The easiest way to do this is to add 
these variables to <your-home>/build.properties (they are populated with sample values)
<p><code>
javaee.home=/as9<br>
javaee.server.name=localhost<br>
javaee.server.port=8080<br>
javaee.domaindir=/as9/domains/domain1<br>
</code>
<h2>How to use the build script</h2>
<ul>
<li>Start the App Server and make sure you have <home>/build.properties setup correctly.
<li>To do everything, simply run ant with no arguments
<li><b>ant compile-deploy-service</b> compiles and deploys the Webservice
</ul>
<h2>The Web Service</h2>
This is an example of  a secure web service.
In this example, a bank account JAX-WS webservice is sent securely using SOAP Message Security.
This is a scenario using X509 Mutual Authentication.
<br>
Client and Server are authenticated and messages integrity and 
confidentiality are provided by using Asymmetric Binding. 
The server X509 certificate is used as Recepient Token and the 
client X509 certificate is used as the Initiator Token.
<br>
All communication uses SOAP messages.
<br>
SignedParts and EncryptedParts assertions are present in the 
corresponding policy, indicating that the headers and Body of the message 
must be signed and encrypted. 

<p>

<h2>Building, Deploying, and Running the Application in NetBeans IDE</h2>
<p>
Follow these instructions to build, deploy, and run
this sample application using NetBeans IDE.
</p>
<ol>
      <li> Refer to  <a href="../../../docs/UserREADME.html"> common build instructions.</a>
       for setting up NetBeans IDE and the application server with which the IDE will use.</li>
  <li> Make sure that you have defined the appropriate values in build.properties based on above
       common build instructions which is a pre-requisite for this sample.
  <li> In NetBeans IDE, select File->OpenProject and select 
<code><i>samples_install_dir</i>/javaee5/webservices/xwss-bank-service</code> as the project.</li>
  <li> Right click on <code>xwss-bank-service</code> and select <code>Run Project</code> which will build, deploy and run the project.</li>
</ol>
<p>
You can verify the Webservice is active by entering this in a browser (example server host and port):
<p><code>
http://localhost:8080/xwss-bank-service/BankAccountService?wsdl
</code>

<p>
The corresponding client code is in the xwss-bank-client project.
